    I can hear player's foot steps from distance in pubg and also u can know easily their angle by hearing the gun shots. You can also spot them by foot steps that they are in your upper floor or lower. Just go to windows sound settings, enhancement, then turn on loudness equalization. And also, build quality is really awesome...Edit:Using it for 1 year and if this headphones got damaged I will again buy the same 1. Its is just awesome go for it don't think.

     Its pretty tight on my head but I like it that way. Sound Quality is clear and I would rate it 8/10. The bass is nice and when increased, it handles the volumes so the song's loudness would not decrease. The CD given isn't working and thats why I give it 4 out of 5. RGB lights keep changing slowly but aren't in sync with both sides. Mic Quality is awesome. The Soft Ear Cups can attract sweat if used for longer times. The headband is metal so it won't break and it fits in nicely.

    I wanted to use these headphones for gaming, they are pretty good in terms of quality of sound, durability and noise cancellation.The only thing which made me give 3 stars is that they are pretty heavy and i mean pretty heavy, like you cant play games wearing these for even 1 hour straight hence I returned these, the top part which is holding the whole thing is made of heavy metal.I was not able to return these in one go as you have to take the replacement of the same item first and then when the replacement arrives you will get an option to return it and get the refund.To sum it up, gaming headphones should be light, so light that you don't even feel you have a headphones on.

    You will like the build quality. It's build solidly. Wires are firm. Cups comfortable. The only reason why I find this a 4-star product is for the sound quality. I have been listening to high quality earphones for years and anything sub-optimal tends to strike me particularly. I noticed a lack of punch in the bass though it will suffice for gaming. Overall it pleases as a gaming headphone where you really need a mic. For music though, I would recommend you spend more. Value for money is good. Go for it if you don't mind a little compromise on Bose-like audio clarity.

    This is an awesome product, and the bass is toooo good.There is something i want to help you guys with.In windows 10, you may notice a bug when device is connected but gives you error anc even does not work when connected.Dont worry, its because of the secure boot which verifies the driver signature blah bhal bhal.Fix: before booting pc go to boot settings.-->then disable secure boot.Thats it.From this everything will work fine.

    If you’re looking for a gaming headphones under 2K then go for it blindly.I’ll tell you what i expected and felt after having my hands on it.Look and feel - It looks like a headphones for Helicopter pilots, it is huge as it is an over the ear headphone but due to the soft paddings it doesn’t bother your comfort level.RGB - Due to its Mesh design over the cups it feels like there is a huge wall inside the cups and somewhat feels like 3D.Sound for Gaming - I play CS Go and You wont be disappointed with the level of details this headphone provides you. Clear footsteps that even my teammates tends to miss.Tip - To get the actual distance idea turn off the 3D sound in the Redgear tool as sometimes it made me give wrong calls( I felt the enemy was closer due to clear crisp and loud sound, but he was far away)  so 10/10 for gaming(cuz it is perfect but you have to tweak it to use it to the fullest)Sound for movies/songs - Equally amazing and now turn the 3D on, it has 50mm driver unit and it reflects in its sound output. I have tweaked equilizer settings for optimum sound while watching movies. ( You have to set windows sound level as well, go to sounds and then properties of USB PNp(Generic name of this headphone) and go to levels and check for loud optimisation. )Bass is ‘ground breaking’ it will vibrate on your head when the heavy bass comes in song, totally amazed by the sound output.Mic - it is as amazing as the headphones, noise cancellation is upto the mark and my teammates says that now they hear my real voice.Cons - first is that it leaks sound, person sitting next to you can hear what you are listening to and second is its RGB lights are not in sync.Go for Cosmo 7.1 if you are looking for allrounder and go for Thunder/Hellfury if you just want Gaming headphones.

    - 7.1 surround is surprisingly good for directional sense while gaming.- Big soundstage, giant earcups surround your ears, and give a very roomy feel.- Sound is pretty good as well.- Microphone is way above average for headsets at this price.- Build quality isn't bad either.- Movies in particular are quite enjoyable too.

    I wanted to use these headphones for gaming, they are pretty good in terms of quality of sound, durability and noise cancellation.The only thing which made me give 3 stars is that they are pretty heavy and i mean pretty heavy, like you cant play games wearing these for even 1 hour straight hence I returned these, the top part which is holding the whole thing is made of heavy metal.I was not able to return these in one go as you have to take the replacement of the same item first and then when the replacement arrives you will get an option to return it and get the refund.To sum it up, gaming headphones should be light, so light that you don't even feel you have a headphones on.

    You will like the build quality. It's build solidly. Wires are firm. Cups comfortable. The only reason why I find this a 4-star product is for the sound quality. I have been listening to high quality earphones for years and anything sub-optimal tends to strike me particularly. I noticed a lack of punch in the bass though it will suffice for gaming. Overall it pleases as a gaming headphone where you really need a mic. For music though, I would recommend you spend more. Value for money is good. Go for it if you don't mind a little compromise on Bose-like audio clarity.

    This is an awesome product, and the bass is toooo good.There is something i want to help you guys with.In windows 10, you may notice a bug when device is connected but gives you error anc even does not work when connected.Dont worry, its because of the secure boot which verifies the driver signature blah bhal bhal.Fix: before booting pc go to boot settings.-->then disable secure boot.Thats it.From this everything will work fine.

    If you’re looking for a gaming headphones under 2K then go for it blindly.I’ll tell you what i expected and felt after having my hands on it.Look and feel - It looks like a headphones for Helicopter pilots, it is huge as it is an over the ear headphone but due to the soft paddings it doesn’t bother your comfort level.RGB - Due to its Mesh design over the cups it feels like there is a huge wall inside the cups and somewhat feels like 3D.Sound for Gaming - I play CS Go and You wont be disappointed with the level of details this headphone provides you. Clear footsteps that even my teammates tends to miss.Tip - To get the actual distance idea turn off the 3D sound in the Redgear tool as sometimes it made me give wrong calls( I felt the enemy was closer due to clear crisp and loud sound, but he was far away)  so 10/10 for gaming(cuz it is perfect but you have to tweak it to use it to the fullest)Sound for movies/songs - Equally amazing and now turn the 3D on, it has 50mm driver unit and it reflects in its sound output. I have tweaked equilizer settings for optimum sound while watching movies. ( You have to set windows sound level as well, go to sounds and then properties of USB PNp(Generic name of this headphone) and go to levels and check for loud optimisation. )Bass is ‘ground breaking’ it will vibrate on your head when the heavy bass comes in song, totally amazed by the sound output.Mic - it is as amazing as the headphones, noise cancellation is upto the mark and my teammates says that now they hear my real voice.Cons - first is that it leaks sound, person sitting next to you can hear what you are listening to and second is its RGB lights are not in sync.Go for Cosmo 7.1 if you are looking for allrounder and go for Thunder/Hellfury if you just want Gaming headphones.

    - 7.1 surround is surprisingly good for directional sense while gaming.- Big soundstage, giant earcups surround your ears, and give a very roomy feel.- Sound is pretty good as well.- Microphone is way above average for headsets at this price.- Build quality isn't bad either.- Movies in particular are quite enjoyable too.

    I can hear player's foot steps from distance in pubg and also u can know easily their angle by hearing the gun shots. You can also spot them by foot steps that they are in your upper floor or lower. Just go to windows sound settings, enhancement, then turn on loudness equalization. And also, build quality is really awesome...Edit:Using it for 1 year and if this headphones got damaged I will again buy the same 1. Its is just awesome go for it don't think.

     Its pretty tight on my head but I like it that way. Sound Quality is clear and I would rate it 8/10. The bass is nice and when increased, it handles the volumes so the song's loudness would not decrease. The CD given isn't working and thats why I give it 4 out of 5. RGB lights keep changing slowly but aren't in sync with both sides. Mic Quality is awesome. The Soft Ear Cups can attract sweat if used for longer times. The headband is metal so it won't break and it fits in nicely.
