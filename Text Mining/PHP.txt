"This film is an epic and absolute comedy with numerous rib-tickling moments.Akshay kumar,Paresh Rawal and Sunil shetty are perfect as the three leads who enter into trouble due to money's greed.Johny lever,Rajpal Yadav,Rimi sen,Sharat saxena,Manoj joshi and all other supporting actors add even more fun and comedy to the film.Last part evokes greatest laughter.ENJOY!"

"Phir Hera Pheri, the sequel to the most endearing cult-comedy of our times has released. I managed to watch it at a paid preview and here is my appraisal of different elements of the movie:Paresh Rawal as Baburao: Of course you start with him. Baburao is the real hero of the movie. Baburao Ganpatrao Apte is one of my (I think a lot of people will agree with me here) all-time favorite screen characters and Paresh currently one of the best actors around. The way he says \"Devaa Devaa, Utalerey\", only he can do it. He gets most of the best punchlines and as expected delivers them flawlessly. Whenever he is on screen, which he is most of the times, the smile hardly fades from your face. He overshadows all flaws in the movie and any blemishes from others. Outstanding work by Paresh Rawal!! What an actor! Rating <U+0096> AAkshay Kumar as Raju: Another fantastic job by him. He is fast becoming the new age comedy icon (if he has already not). There is never a dull moment with him around and he is just getting better with each film. After Mujhse Shaadi Karogi and Garam Masala another knockout performance by him. Check him out when he says \"Haaye Mujhe Sharm Aati Hai\" or in the maze scene during climax (which is a laugh riot) or the way he addresses Rimii with different names. Well done. Rating <U+0096> ASuneil Shetty as Shyam: He is the quintessential action guy who is trying his hand at other roles. His comedy roles like in Hera Pheri, Hulchul, Awara Pagal Deewana have been OK. He is not really that great an actor at comedy (On second thoughts in any role) but still somehow manages to hold his own. Here also he holds his own, but he needs to improve somehow or will be reduced to playing inconsequential character roles (irrespective of whether you change the spelling of your name or not). Here he is fine and actually some of his shortcomings are overshadowed by others. Rating <U+0096> B+Johnny Lever as Munna: One of the most popular comedians ever but he has not been in form in recent times. Here he is back in form as Munna a small time crook who wants to be big by robbing his earlier master. Some of his dialogues are funny. Only problem, his character could have been etched better. Rating <U+0096> B+Rajpal Yadav as Pappu: Another current favorite. Problem he does get much scope to prove his ability, but he has his moments. Rating <U+0096> BBipasha and Rimi: They don't get much scope at all. Bipasha looks hot throughout but I think that is what she was required to do as her acting skills are ahem<U+0085>Rimi on the other hand looks lost. Anyway not much was expected from their characters. Rating <U+0096> BSharad Saxena as Tiwari: Amazing performance!! As \"Totla Tiwari\" he is riot. He is the don whose money is conned (it's too complicated to explain here) and he expects our heroes to give it back. His character can't talk properly and his scenes with Baburao make you laugh your guts out. Rating <U+0096> AThere are a host of comedians in the movie. But most of the others don't get much scope as this is entirely the story of Baburao, Raju and Shyam. Suresh Menon (Munna's spy in Nanjibhai's camp) and Manoj Joshi (Kachra Seth) are very good. Rating <U+0096> B+ Bhojpuri superstar and one time Hindi film hero Ravi Kissen as Tiwari's henchman is also good Rating <U+0096> B+ Dinesh Hingoo, Milind Gunaji, Razzak Khan are OK. Sunil Pal is wasted. The gorilla and the \"man with no visible head\" (or Qutb Minar as Akshay puts it) are fun.Dialogues: Special mention for the dialogues. This movie has some fantastic dialogues. I won't spoil the fun by mentioning them here. Rating <U+0096> AMusic: Himesh Reshammiya can do no wrong currently. Aye Meri Zohrajbeen is a fantastic number and the video is, you've all seen it on music channels, fantastic. The others songs are time pass.Director: Satish Kaushik was supposed to do this movie but he pulled out and Neeraj Vora the writer has directed this. Considering his previous accomplishment as director (Khiladi 420 anyone), this is an amazing achievement. He has improved by leaps and bounds. It is never easy to direct a comedy that too a sequel and make a good job of it. A sequel always has to endure comparisons to the first part. This is not just another comedy but a sequel to Hera Pheri whose characters have now achieved cult status. There is never a dull moment. The movie moves at a very fast pace which gives you no time to brood over what is happening. Just enjoy the happenings as it is. What a job by Neeraj in this movie. Rating <U+0096> AThe movie has some amazing performances and dialogues. There are some references to the first part like the song \"Golmal Hain Bhai Sab Golmal Hai\" in the background or the \"Dhoti Utaale\" scene. But it is still enjoyable. Certain characters could have been avoided. One jarring note was the climax. I didn't like most of it much but people around me were in splits, maybe it was beyond my sensibilities. It will no doubt be compared to the first part. Some will like it and some will not. But don't let the comparisons deter you from watching the best comedy of the year so far. Overall, it is complete time pass. Rating <U+0096> B+The way the movie ends leaves scope for another sequel (Maybe called \"Ek Aur Hera Pheri). Can't have enough of Baburao, Raju and Shyam, so bring it on.Appraisal Rating Definitions: A -- Fantastic/Excellent B+ -- Very Good B -- Good B- -- OK C -- Poor"

"This movie was a decently directed movie in the sense that it makes you laugh most of the times it was meant to, but no one can take over Priyadarshan. Certain scenes and dialogs were not funny at all like the ones when Babu Rao talks about his telephone in the beginning and when he comes to take the money in his chaul house to not believe it really is his home, also when Raju peeks into Johny Lever's apartment through the picture and several such scenes. Priyadarshan never includes lame comedy scenes or dialogs in his movies. Yet, the climax was a very Priyadarshan style where the comedy goes long into several groups fighting with each other like in Hera Pheri (part 1). Moreover, certain scenes and dialogs were repetitive. For instance, the two tall black villains added no substance what-so-ever and the Rs.1000 scene with Raju and his girl was over done the first time and thereon had the same concept repeating in subsequent scenes. Since most people only count the times they laugh to judge a comedy movie, I would say it's a great laughter movie and every couple of minutes, you find yourself either laughing or smiling. So if you haven't yet, go watch it!"

"It was really funny!! Baburoa played by Paresh Rawal was superb, and so was Akshay Kumars character, although Sunil Shetty'z character didn't shine through as much as in Hera Pheri!! The Chemistry between the three was great to watch, the characters haven't changed in the way they act they still get themselves into trouble and this time round they get into such a big mess!! I cant say that it is better then the first one because the Original is always the best!! Overall i believe that the film is good to watch and my comment is only based on the first time i watched it so If u ain't seen it GO 2 c it or get it on DVD when it releases because it definitely will have u kneeling over with laughter!!!"

"Its indeed first is always first but the 2nd one really shocked everyone as it was no where near 2nd part of Mallu movie Ramji Rao Speaking...and all the credit goes to Neeraj! Not to forget the Hera Pheri 1st where Paresh himself mentioning after receiving the best actor award...that the credit goes to Neeraj as Paresh is a total guju guy and due to Neeraj..he could project the marathi guy in 1st movie..all credit goes to the script writer and his perception as even the director directs but the key sense to the soul is the script writer..and I would say being a 2nd it really bags the credit for what it has done! A movie which will chuckle your bones and you don't worry about anything when you are driving back to home... Kudos to Neeraj the comedy king Cheers"

"The favourite comic trio of every Bollywood movie lover is back. They have done a splendid job again. Raju is more notorious, Shyam is a little foolish but Babu Bhaiyya has lost his mind completely!! It's an excellent movie but many say that it's not as good as the prequel but I would like to say that you definitely laughed more while watching this movie. Neeraj Vora is a good director. Nice dialogue delivery. The scenes repeated from the prequel are equally funny. This movie is in no way behind its prequel. This movie will surely remain a fan-favourite like its predecessor. Watch it again and again but it'll always make you laugh."
"When I went into this movie, I didn't know what to expect. I loved the first movie, and didn't think they could top it. But soon I realized this movie was better. Through out the whole movie I was laughing and having a great time.Paresh Rawal was of course the funniest character. I love all of his movies, and this was one of the best. His role as Baburao Apte was fantastic. Akshaye Kumar did the best acting. He fulfilled the role of Raju. And of course Sunil Shetty did great. But out of the three I liked Raju and Baburao more but that doesn't mean Shyam didn't do a great role.This movie was full of laughs, and the story had so many turns and twists. If you loved the first then you will love this. Even if you haven't seen the first one, watch this one anyway. I had a great time."

"i watched this movie last week and i would like to comment on it because the movie was really comedy and rib ticking stuff and i just fell down of my bed laughing badly on the last scenes .I didn't expect this much comedy which it was and i even didn't expect the verdict super-hit from the movie i thought it would be a stupid comedy like the ones these days but it was out of my expectations that the movie was one of my favorite Hindi comedy movies if you didn't watch this movie just watch it and you will be entertained by this great entertainer.but in the end there was a even a mystery which would rather be solved in pair Hera Peri part 3 laugh out loud"
"This film is an epic and absolute comedy with numerous rib-tickling moments.Akshay kumar,Paresh Rawal and Sunil shetty are perfect as the three leads who enter into trouble due to money's greed.Johny lever,Rajpal Yadav,Rimi sen,Sharat saxena,Manoj joshi and all other supporting actors add even more fun and comedy to the film.Last part evokes greatest laughter.ENJOY!"

Watch it again and again but it'll always make you laugh."
"When I went into this movie, I didn't know what to expect. I loved the first movie, and didn't think they could top it. But soon I realized this movie was better. Through out the whole movie I was laughing and having a great time.Paresh Rawal was of course the funniest character. I love all of his movies, and this was one of the best. His role as Baburao Apte was fantastic. Akshaye Kumar did the best acting. He fulfilled the role of Raju. And of course Sunil Shetty did great. But out of the three I liked Raju and Baburao more but that doesn't mean Shyam didn't do a great role.This movie was full of laughs, and the story had so many turns and twists. If you loved the first then you will love this. Even if you haven't seen the first one, watch this one anyway. I had a great time."

"i watched this movie last week and i would like to comment on it because the movie was really comedy and rib ticking stuff and i just fell down of my bed laughing badly on the last scenes .I didn't expect this much comedy which it was and i even didn't expect the verdict super-hit from the movie i thought it would be a stupid comedy like the ones these days but it was out of my expectations that the movie was one of my favorite Hindi comedy movies if you didn't watch this movie just watch it and you will be entertained by this great entertainer.but in the end there was a even a mystery which would rather be solved in pair Hera Peri part 3 laugh out loud"
"This film is an epic and absolute comedy with numerous rib-tickling moments.Akshay kumar,Paresh Rawal and Sunil shetty are perfect as the three leads who enter into trouble due to money's greed.Johny lever,Rajpal Yadav,Rimi sen,Sharat saxena,Manoj joshi and all other supporting actors add even more fun and comedy to the film.Last part evokes greatest laughter.ENJOY!"

"Phir Hera Pheri, the sequel to the most endearing cult-comedy of our times has released. I managed to watch it at a paid preview and here is my appraisal of different elements of the movie:Paresh Rawal as Baburao: Of course you start with him. Baburao is the real hero of the movie. Baburao Ganpatrao Apte is one of my (I think a lot of people will agree with me here) all-time favorite screen characters and Paresh currently one of the best actors around. The way he says \"Devaa Devaa, Utalerey\", only he can do it. He gets most of the best punchlines and as expected delivers them flawlessly. Whenever he is on screen, which he is most of the times, the smile hardly fades from your face. He overshadows all flaws in the movie and any blemishes from others. Outstanding work by Paresh Rawal!! What an actor! Rating <U+0096> AAkshay Kumar as Raju: Another fantastic job by him. He is fast becoming the new age comedy icon (if he has already not). There is never a dull moment with him around and he is just getting better with each film. After Mujhse Shaadi Karogi and Garam Masala another knockout performance by him. Check him out when he says \"Haaye Mujhe Sharm Aati Hai\" or in the maze scene during climax (which is a laugh riot) or the way he addresses Rimii with different names. Well done. Rating <U+0096> ASuneil Shetty as Shyam: He is the quintessential action guy who is trying his hand at other roles. His comedy roles like in Hera Pheri, Hulchul, Awara Pagal Deewana have been OK. He is not really that great an actor at comedy (On second thoughts in any role) but still somehow manages to hold his own. Here also he holds his own, but he needs to improve somehow or will be reduced to playing inconsequential character roles (irrespective of whether you change the spelling of your name or not). Here he is fine and actually some of his shortcomings are overshadowed by others. Rating <U+0096> B+Johnny Lever as Munna: One of the most popular comedians ever but he has not been in form in recent times. Here he is back in form as Munna a small time crook who wants to be big by robbing his earlier master. Some of his dialogues are funny. Only problem, his character could have been etched better. Rating <U+0096> B+Rajpal Yadav as Pappu: Another current favorite. Problem he does get much scope to prove his ability, but he has his moments. Rating <U+0096> BBipasha and Rimi: They don't get much scope at all. Bipasha looks hot throughout but I think that is what she was required to do as her acting skills are ahem<U+0085>Rimi on the other hand looks lost. Anyway not much was expected from their characters. Rating <U+0096> BSharad Saxena as Tiwari: Amazing performance!! As \"Totla Tiwari\" he is riot. He is the don whose money is conned (it's too complicated to explain here) and he expects our heroes to give it back. His character can't talk properly and his scenes with Baburao make you laugh your guts out. Rating <U+0096> AThere are a host of comedians in the movie. But most of the others don't get much scope as this is entirely the story of Baburao, Raju and Shyam. Suresh Menon (Munna's spy in Nanjibhai's camp) and Manoj Joshi (Kachra Seth) are very good. Rating <U+0096> B+ Bhojpuri superstar and one time Hindi film hero Ravi Kissen as Tiwari's henchman is also good Rating <U+0096> B+ Dinesh Hingoo, Milind Gunaji, Razzak Khan are OK. Sunil Pal is wasted. The gorilla and the \"man with no visible head\" (or Qutb Minar as Akshay puts it) are fun.Dialogues: Special mention for the dialogues. This movie has some fantastic dialogues. I won't spoil the fun by mentioning them here. Rating <U+0096> AMusic: Himesh Reshammiya can do no wrong currently. Aye Meri Zohrajbeen is a fantastic number and the video is, you've all seen it on music channels, fantastic. The others songs are time pass.Director: Satish Kaushik was supposed to do this movie but he pulled out and Neeraj Vora the writer has directed this. Considering his previous accomplishment as director (Khiladi 420 anyone), this is an amazing achievement. He has improved by leaps and bounds. It is never easy to direct a comedy that too a sequel and make a good job of it. A sequel always has to endure comparisons to the first part. This is not just another comedy but a sequel to Hera Pheri whose characters have now achieved cult status. There is never a dull moment. The movie moves at a very fast pace which gives you no time to brood over what is happening. Just enjoy the happenings as it is. What a job by Neeraj in this movie. Rating <U+0096> AThe movie has some amazing performances and dialogues. There are some references to the first part like the song \"Golmal Hain Bhai Sab Golmal Hai\" in the background or the \"Dhoti Utaale\" scene. But it is still enjoyable. Certain characters could have been avoided. One jarring note was the climax. I didn't like most of it much but people around me were in splits, maybe it was beyond my sensibilities. It will no doubt be compared to the first part. Some will like it and some will not. But don't let the comparisons deter you from watching the best comedy of the year so far. Overall, it is complete time pass. Rating <U+0096> B+The way the movie ends leaves scope for another sequel (Maybe called \"Ek Aur Hera Pheri). Can't have enough of Baburao, Raju and Shyam, so bring it on.Appraisal Rating Definitions: A -- Fantastic/Excellent B+ -- Very Good B -- Good B- -- OK C -- Poor"

"This movie was a decently directed movie in the sense that it makes you laugh most of the times it was meant to, but no one can take over Priyadarshan. Certain scenes and dialogs were not funny at all like the ones when Babu Rao talks about his telephone in the beginning and when he comes to take the money in his chaul house to not believe it really is his home, also when Raju peeks into Johny Lever's apartment through the picture and several such scenes. Priyadarshan never includes lame comedy scenes or dialogs in his movies. Yet, the climax was a very Priyadarshan style where the comedy goes long into several groups fighting with each other like in Hera Pheri (part 1). Moreover, certain scenes and dialogs were repetitive. For instance, the two tall black villains added no substance what-so-ever and the Rs.1000 scene with Raju and his girl was over done the first time and thereon had the same concept repeating in subsequent scenes. Since most people only count the times they laugh to judge a comedy movie, I would say it's a great laughter movie and every couple of minutes, you find yourself either laughing or smiling. So if you haven't yet, go watch it!"

"It was really funny!! Baburoa played by Paresh Rawal was superb, and so was Akshay Kumars character, although Sunil Shetty'z character didn't shine through as much as in Hera Pheri!! The Chemistry between the three was great to watch, the characters haven't changed in the way they act they still get themselves into trouble and this time round they get into such a big mess!! I cant say that it is better then the first one because the Original is always the best!! Overall i believe that the film is good to watch and my comment is only based on the first time i watched it so If u ain't seen it GO 2 c it or get it on DVD when it releases because it definitely will have u kneeling over with laughter!!!"

"Its indeed first is always first but the 2nd one really shocked everyone as it was no where near 2nd part of Mallu movie Ramji Rao Speaking...and all the credit goes to Neeraj! Not to forget the Hera Pheri 1st where Paresh himself mentioning after receiving the best actor award...that the credit goes to Neeraj as Paresh is a total guju guy and due to Neeraj..he could project the marathi guy in 1st movie..all credit goes to the script writer and his perception as even the director directs but the key sense to the soul is the script writer..and I would say being a 2nd it really bags the credit for what it has done! A movie which will chuckle your bones and you don't worry about anything when you are driving back to home... Kudos to Neeraj the comedy king Cheers"

"The favourite comic trio of every Bollywood movie lover is back. They have done a splendid job again.

Nice dialogue delivery. The scenes repeated from the prequel are equally funny. This movie is in no way behind its prequel. This movie will surely remain a fan-favourite like its predecessor.

"Its indeed first is always first but the 2nd one really shocked everyone as it was no where near 2nd part of Mallu movie Ramji Rao Speaking...and all the credit goes to Neeraj! Not to forget the Hera Pheri 1st where Paresh himself mentioning after receiving the best actor award...that the credit goes to Neeraj as Paresh is a total guju guy and due to Neeraj..he could project the marathi guy in 1st movie..all credit goes to the script writer and his perception as even the director directs but the key sense to the soul is the script writer..and I would say being a 2nd it really bags the credit for what it has done! A movie which will chuckle your bones and you don't worry about anything when you are driving back to home... Kudos to Neeraj the comedy king Cheers"

"The favourite comic trio of every Bollywood movie lover is back. They have done a splendid job again. Raju is more notorious, Shyam is a little foolish but Babu Bhaiyya has lost his mind completely!! It's an excellent movie but many say that it's not as good as the prequel but I would like to say that you definitely laughed more while watching this movie. Neeraj Vora is a good director. Nice dialogue delivery. The scenes repeated from the prequel are equally funny. This movie is in no way behind its prequel. This movie will surely remain a fan-favourite like its predecessor. Watch it again and again but it'll always make you laugh."
"When I went into this movie, I didn't know what to expect. I loved the first movie, and didn't think they could top it. But soon I realized this movie was better. Through out the whole movie I was laughing and having a great time.Paresh Rawal was of course the funniest character. I love all of his movies, and this was one of the best. His role as Baburao Apte was fantastic. Akshaye Kumar did the best acting. He fulfilled the role of Raju. And of course Sunil Shetty did great. But out of the three I liked Raju and Baburao more but that doesn't mean Shyam didn't do a great role.This movie was full of laughs, and the story had so many turns and twists. If you loved the first then you will love this. Even if you haven't seen the first one, watch this one anyway. I had a great time."

"i watched this movie last week and i would like to comment on it because the movie was really comedy and rib ticking stuff and i just fell down of my bed laughing badly on the last scenes .I didn't expect this much comedy which it was and i even didn't expect the verdict super-hit from the movie i thought it would be a stupid comedy like the ones these days but it was out of my expectations that the movie was one of my favorite Hindi comedy movies if you didn't watch this movie just watch it and you will be entertained by this great entertainer.but in the end there was a even a mystery which would rather be solved in pair Hera Peri part 3 laugh out loud"
"This film is an epic and absolute comedy with numerous rib-tickling moments.Akshay kumar,Paresh Rawal and Sunil shetty are perfect as the three leads who enter into trouble due to money's greed.Johny lever,Rajpal Yadav,Rimi sen,Sharat saxena,Manoj joshi and all other supporting actors add even more fun and comedy to the film.Last part evokes greatest laughter.ENJOY!"

"Phir Hera Pheri, the sequel to the most endearing cult-comedy of our times has released. I managed to watch it at a paid preview and here is my appraisal of different elements of the movie:Paresh Rawal as Baburao: Of course you start with him. Baburao is the real hero of the movie. Baburao Ganpatrao Apte is one of my (I think a lot of people will agree with me here) all-time favorite screen characters and Paresh currently one of the best actors around. The way he says \"Devaa Devaa, Utalerey\", only he can do it. He gets most of the best punchlines and as expected delivers them flawlessly. Whenever he is on screen, which he is most of the times, the smile hardly fades from your face. He overshadows all flaws in the movie and any blemishes from others. Outstanding work by Paresh Rawal!! What an actor! Rating <U+0096> AAkshay Kumar as Raju: Another fantastic job by him. He is fast becoming the new age comedy icon (if he has already not). There is never a dull moment with him around and he is just getting better with each film. After Mujhse Shaadi Karogi and Garam Masala another knockout performance by him. Check him out when he says \"Haaye Mujhe Sharm Aati Hai\" or in the maze scene during climax (which is a laugh riot) or the way he addresses Rimii with different names. Well done. Rating <U+0096> ASuneil Shetty as Shyam: He is the quintessential action guy who is trying his hand at other roles. His comedy roles like in Hera Pheri, Hulchul, Awara Pagal Deewana have been OK. He is not really that great an actor at comedy (On second thoughts in any role) but still somehow manages to hold his own. Here also he holds his own, but he needs to improve somehow or will be reduced to playing inconsequential character roles (irrespective of whether you change the spelling of your name or not). Here he is fine and actually some of his shortcomings are overshadowed by others. Rating <U+0096> B+Johnny Lever as Munna: One of the most popular comedians ever but he has not been in form in recent times. Here he is back in form as Munna a small time crook who wants to be big by robbing his earlier master. Some of his dialogues are funny. Only problem, his character could have been etched better. Rating <U+0096> B+Rajpal Yadav as Pappu: Another current favorite. Problem he does get much scope to prove his ability, but he has his moments. Rating <U+0096> BBipasha and Rimi: They don't get much scope at all. Bipasha looks hot throughout but I think that is what she was required to do as her acting skills are ahem<U+0085>Rimi on the other hand looks lost. Anyway not much was expected from their characters. Rating <U+0096> BSharad Saxena as Tiwari: Amazing performance!! As \"Totla Tiwari\" he is riot. He is the don whose money is conned (it's too complicated to explain here) and he expects our heroes to give it back. His character can't talk properly and his scenes with Baburao make you laugh your guts out. Rating <U+0096> AThere are a host of comedians in the movie. But most of the others don't get much scope as this is entirely the story of Baburao, Raju and Shyam. Suresh Menon (Munna's spy in Nanjibhai's camp) and Manoj Joshi (Kachra Seth) are very good. Rating <U+0096> B+ Bhojpuri superstar and one time Hindi film hero Ravi Kissen as Tiwari's henchman is also good Rating <U+0096> B+ Dinesh Hingoo, Milind Gunaji, Razzak Khan are OK. Sunil Pal is wasted. The gorilla and the \"man with no visible head\" (or Qutb Minar as Akshay puts it) are fun.Dialogues: Special mention for the dialogues. This movie has some fantastic dialogues. I won't spoil the fun by mentioning them here. Rating <U+0096> AMusic: Himesh Reshammiya can do no wrong currently. Aye Meri Zohrajbeen is a fantastic number and the video is, you've all seen it on music channels, fantastic. The others songs are time pass.Director: Satish Kaushik was supposed to do this movie but he pulled out and Neeraj Vora the writer has directed this. Considering his previous accomplishment as director (Khiladi 420 anyone), this is an amazing achievement. He has improved by leaps and bounds. It is never easy to direct a comedy that too a sequel and make a good job of it. A sequel always has to endure comparisons to the first part. This is not just another comedy but a sequel to Hera Pheri whose characters have now achieved cult status. There is never a dull moment. The movie moves at a very fast pace which gives you no time to brood over what is happening. Just enjoy the happenings as it is. What a job by Neeraj in this movie. Rating <U+0096> AThe movie has some amazing performances and dialogues. There are some references to the first part like the song \"Golmal Hain Bhai Sab Golmal Hai\" in the background or the \"Dhoti Utaale\" scene. But it is still enjoyable. Certain characters could have been avoided. One jarring note was the climax. I didn't like most of it much but people around me were in splits, maybe it was beyond my sensibilities. It will no doubt be compared to the first part. Some will like it and some will not. But don't let the comparisons deter you from watching the best comedy of the year so far. Overall, it is complete time pass. Rating <U+0096> B+The way the movie ends leaves scope for another sequel (Maybe called \"Ek Aur Hera Pheri). Can't have enough of Baburao, Raju and Shyam, so bring it on.Appraisal Rating Definitions: A -- Fantastic/Excellent B+ -- Very Good B -- Good B- -- OK C -- Poor"

"This movie was a decently directed movie in the sense that it makes you laugh most of the times it was meant to, but no one can take over Priyadarshan. Certain scenes and dialogs were not funny at all like the ones when Babu Rao talks about his telephone in the beginning and when he comes to take the money in his chaul house to not believe it really is his home, also when Raju peeks into Johny Lever's apartment through the picture and several such scenes. Priyadarshan never includes lame comedy scenes or dialogs in his movies. Yet, the climax was a very Priyadarshan style where the comedy goes long into several groups fighting with each other like in Hera Pheri (part 1). Moreover, certain scenes and dialogs were repetitive. For instance, the two tall black villains added no substance what-so-ever and the Rs.1000 scene with Raju and his girl was over done the first time and thereon had the same concept repeating in subsequent scenes. Since most people only count the times they laugh to judge a comedy movie, I would say it's a great laughter movie and every couple of minutes, you find yourself either laughing or smiling. So if you haven't yet, go watch it!"

"It was really funny!! Baburoa played by Paresh Rawal was superb, and so was Akshay Kumars character, although Sunil Shetty'z character didn't shine through as much as in Hera Pheri!! The Chemistry between the three was great to watch, the characters haven't changed in the way they act they still get themselves into trouble and this time round they get into such a big mess!! I cant say that it is better then the first one because the Original is always the best!! Overall i believe that the film is good to watch and my comment is only based on the first time i watched it so If u ain't seen it GO 2 c it or get it on DVD when it releases because it definitely will have u kneeling over with laughter!!!"

"i saw this film last night and when it finished it got a big clapping send off from the audience. speaks volumes!! i think on the whole, with some reservations, this is more evenly paced and humorous than the original. however it does have its own demerits namely that this time the famous trio have been reduced to cartoon characters. there is a lot more fun but at the same time they all go over the top. this was the beauty of the original. they were all simple and believable characters. but situational comedy has been replaced by sheer slapstick. another thing there are a lot of references to Brit film lock stock. that was a put off. also i think paresh rawal needs to give it a break. he is the funny man yet again and boy he is good at it, but i am sure i don't want to watch him again in a funny character in near future. on the flip side, the chemistry between the three was amazing. in fact its their constant bickering that keeps redeeming the film time after time. suniel shetty was alright, more like a catalyst for the other two superior actors do their job. akshay kumar, well, what can i say?? his unbridled zealousness raises the film by leaps and bounds. he was in his home territory and like paresh rawal will have you in splits. rest of the cast did their part well. on the whole a great film for escapism!"

Overall i believe that the film is good to watch and my comment is only based on the first time i watched it so If u ain't seen it GO 2 c it or get it on DVD when it releases because it definitely will have u kneeling over with laughter!!!"

"i saw this film last night and when it finished it got a big clapping send off from the audience. speaks volumes!! i think on the whole, with some reservations, this is more evenly paced and humorous than the original. however it does have its own demerits namely that this time the famous trio have been reduced to cartoon characters. there is a lot more fun but at the same time they all go over the top. this was the beauty of the original. they were all simple and believable characters. but situational comedy has been replaced by sheer slapstick. another thing there are a lot of references to Brit film lock stock. that was a put off. also i think paresh rawal needs to give it a break. he is the funny man yet again and boy he is good at it, but i am sure i don't want to watch him again in a funny character in near future. on the flip side, the chemistry between the three was amazing. in fact its their constant bickering that keeps redeeming the film time after time. suniel shetty was alright, more like a catalyst for the other two superior actors do their job. akshay kumar, well, what can i say?? his unbridled zealousness raises the film by leaps and bounds. he was in his home territory and like paresh rawal will have you in splits. rest of the cast did their part well. on the whole a great film for escapism!"

"Its indeed first is always first but the 2nd one really shocked everyone as it was no where near 2nd part of Mallu movie Ramji Rao Speaking...and all the credit goes to Neeraj! Not to forget the Hera Pheri 1st where Paresh himself mentioning after receiving the best actor award...that the credit goes to Neeraj as Paresh is a total guju guy and due to Neeraj..he could project the marathi guy in 1st movie..all credit goes to the script writer and his perception as even the director directs but the key sense to the soul is the script writer..and I would say being a 2nd it really bags the credit for what it has done! A movie which will chuckle your bones and you don't worry about anything when you are driving back to home... Kudos to Neeraj the comedy king Cheers"

"The favourite comic trio of every Bollywood movie lover is back. They have done a splendid job again. Raju is more notorious, Shyam is a little foolish but Babu Bhaiyya has lost his mind completely!! It's an excellent movie but many say that it's not as good as the prequel but I would like to say that you definitely laughed more while watching this movie. Neeraj Vora is a good director. Nice dialogue delivery. The scenes repeated from the prequel are equally funny. This movie is in no way behind its prequel. This movie will surely remain a fan-favourite like its predecessor. Watch it again and again but it'll always make you laugh."
"When I went into this movie, I didn't know what to expect. I loved the first movie, and didn't think they could top it. But soon I realized this movie was better. Through out the whole movie I was laughing and having a great time.Paresh Rawal was of course the funniest character. I love all of his movies, and this was one of the best. His role as Baburao Apte was fantastic. Akshaye Kumar did the best acting. He fulfilled the role of Raju. And of course Sunil Shetty did great. But out of the three I liked Raju and Baburao more but that doesn't mean Shyam didn't do a great role.This movie was full of laughs, and the story had so many turns and twists. If you loved the first then you will love this. Even if you haven't seen the first one, watch this one anyway. I had a great time."

"This film is an epic and absolute comedy with numerous rib-tickling moments.Akshay kumar,Paresh Rawal and Sunil shetty are perfect as the three leads who enter into trouble due to money's greed.Johny lever,Rajpal Yadav,Rimi sen,Sharat saxena,Manoj joshi and all other supporting actors add even more fun and comedy to the film.Last part evokes greatest laughter.ENJOY!"

"Phir Hera Pheri, the sequel to the most endearing cult-comedy of our times has released. I managed to watch it at a paid preview and here is my appraisal of different elements of the movie:Paresh Rawal as Baburao: Of course you start with him. Baburao is the real hero of the movie. Baburao Ganpatrao Apte is one of my (I think a lot of people will agree with me here) all-time favorite screen characters and Paresh currently one of the best actors around. The way he says \"Devaa Devaa, Utalerey\", only he can do it. He gets most of the best punchlines and as expected delivers them flawlessly. Whenever he is on screen, which he is most of the times, the smile hardly fades from your face. He overshadows all flaws in the movie and any blemishes from others. Outstanding work by Paresh Rawal!! What an actor! Rating <U+0096> AAkshay Kumar as Raju: Another fantastic job by him. He is fast becoming the new age comedy icon (if he has already not). There is never a dull moment with him around and he is just getting better with each film. After Mujhse Shaadi Karogi and Garam Masala another knockout performance by him. Check him out when he says \"Haaye Mujhe Sharm Aati Hai\" or in the maze scene during climax (which is a laugh riot) or the way he addresses Rimii with different names. Well done. Rating <U+0096> ASuneil Shetty as Shyam: He is the quintessential action guy who is trying his hand at other roles. His comedy roles like in Hera Pheri, Hulchul, Awara Pagal Deewana have been OK. He is not really that great an actor at comedy (On second thoughts in any role) but still somehow manages to hold his own. Here also he holds his own, but he needs to improve somehow or will be reduced to playing inconsequential character roles (irrespective of whether you change the spelling of your name or not). Here he is fine and actually some of his shortcomings are overshadowed by others. Rating <U+0096> B+Johnny Lever as Munna: One of the most popular comedians ever but he has not been in form in recent times. Here he is back in form as Munna a small time crook who wants to be big by robbing his earlier master. Some of his dialogues are funny. Only problem, his character could have been etched better. Rating <U+0096> B+Rajpal Yadav as Pappu: Another current favorite. Problem he does get much scope to prove his ability, but he has his moments. Rating <U+0096> BBipasha and Rimi: They don't get much scope at all. Bipasha looks hot throughout but I think that is what she was required to do as her acting skills are ahem<U+0085>Rimi on the other hand looks lost. Anyway not much was expected from their characters. Rating <U+0096> BSharad Saxena as Tiwari: Amazing performance!! As \"Totla Tiwari\" he is riot. He is the don whose money is conned (it's too complicated to explain here) and he expects our heroes to give it back. His character can't talk properly and his scenes with Baburao make you laugh your guts out. Rating <U+0096> AThere are a host of comedians in the movie. But most of the others don't get much scope as this is entirely the story of Baburao, Raju and Shyam. Suresh Menon (Munna's spy in Nanjibhai's camp) and Manoj Joshi (Kachra Seth) are very good. Rating <U+0096> B+ Bhojpuri superstar and one time Hindi film hero Ravi Kissen as Tiwari's henchman is also good Rating <U+0096> B+ Dinesh Hingoo, Milind Gunaji, Razzak Khan are OK. Sunil Pal is wasted. The gorilla and the \"man with no visible head\" (or Qutb Minar as Akshay puts it) are fun.Dialogues: Special mention for the dialogues. This movie has some fantastic dialogues. I won't spoil the fun by mentioning them here. Rating <U+0096> AMusic: Himesh Reshammiya can do no wrong currently. Aye Meri Zohrajbeen is a fantastic number and the video is, you've all seen it on music channels, fantastic. The others songs are time pass.Director: Satish Kaushik was supposed to do this movie but he pulled out and Neeraj Vora the writer has directed this. Considering his previous accomplishment as director (Khiladi 420 anyone), this is an amazing achievement. He has improved by leaps and bounds. It is never easy to direct a comedy that too a sequel and make a good job of it. A sequel always has to endure comparisons to the first part. This is not just another comedy but a sequel to Hera Pheri whose characters have now achieved cult status. There is never a dull moment. The movie moves at a very fast pace which gives you no time to brood over what is happening. Just enjoy the happenings as it is. What a job by Neeraj in this movie. Rating <U+0096> AThe movie has some amazing performances and dialogues. There are some references to the first part like the song \"Golmal Hain Bhai Sab Golmal Hai\" in the background or the \"Dhoti Utaale\" scene. But it is still enjoyable. Certain characters could have been avoided. One jarring note was the climax. I didn't like most of it much but people around me were in splits, maybe it was beyond my sensibilities. It will no doubt be compared to the first part. Some will like it and some will not. But don't let the comparisons deter you from watching the best comedy of the year so far. Overall, it is complete time pass. Rating <U+0096> B+The way the movie ends leaves scope for another sequel (Maybe called \"Ek Aur Hera Pheri). Can't have enough of Baburao, Raju and Shyam, so bring it on.Appraisal Rating Definitions: A -- Fantastic/Excellent B+ -- Very Good B -- Good B- -- OK C -- Poor"

"This movie was a decently directed movie in the sense that it makes you laugh most of the times it was meant to, but no one can take over Priyadarshan. Certain scenes and dialogs were not funny at all like the ones when Babu Rao talks about his telephone in the beginning and when he comes to take the money in his chaul house to not believe it really is his home, also when Raju peeks into Johny Lever's apartment through the picture and several such scenes. Priyadarshan never includes lame comedy scenes or dialogs in his movies. Yet, the climax was a very Priyadarshan style where the comedy goes long into several groups fighting with each other like in Hera Pheri (part 1). Moreover, certain scenes and dialogs were repetitive. For instance, the two tall black villains added no substance what-so-ever and the Rs.1000 scene with Raju and his girl was over done the first time and thereon had the same concept repeating in subsequent scenes. Since most people only count the times they laugh to judge a comedy movie, I would say it's a great laughter movie and every couple of minutes, you find yourself either laughing or smiling. So if you haven't yet, go watch it!"

"It was really funny!! Baburoa played by Paresh Rawal was superb, and so was Akshay Kumars character, although Sunil Shetty'z character didn't shine through as much as in Hera Pheri!! The Chemistry between the three was great to watch, the characters haven't changed in the way they act they still get themselves into trouble and this time round they get into such a big mess!! I cant say that it is better then the first one because the Original is always the best!!

"This movie was a decently directed movie in the sense that it makes you laugh most of the times it was meant to, but no one can take over Priyadarshan. Certain scenes and dialogs were not funny at all like the ones when Babu Rao talks about his telephone in the beginning and when he comes to take the money in his chaul house to not believe it really is his home, also when Raju peeks into Johny Lever's apartment through the picture and several such scenes. Priyadarshan never includes lame comedy scenes or dialogs in his movies. Yet, the climax was a very Priyadarshan style where the comedy goes long into several groups fighting with each other like in Hera Pheri (part 1). Moreover, certain scenes and dialogs were repetitive. For instance, the two tall black villains added no substance what-so-ever and the Rs.1000 scene with Raju and his girl was over done the first time and thereon had the same concept repeating in subsequent scenes. Since most people only count the times they laugh to judge a comedy movie, I would say it's a great laughter movie and every couple of minutes, you find yourself either laughing or smiling. So if you haven't yet, go watch it!"

"It was really funny!! Baburoa played by Paresh Rawal was superb, and so was Akshay Kumars character, although Sunil Shetty'z character didn't shine through as much as in Hera Pheri!! The Chemistry between the three was great to watch, the characters haven't changed in the way they act they still get themselves into trouble and this time round they get into such a big mess!! I cant say that it is better then the first one because the Original is always the best!! Overall i believe that the film is good to watch and my comment is only based on the first time i watched it so If u ain't seen it GO 2 c it or get it on DVD when it releases because it definitely will have u kneeling over with laughter!!!"

"i saw this film last night and when it finished it got a big clapping send off from the audience. speaks volumes!! i think on the whole, with some reservations, this is more evenly paced and humorous than the original. however it does have its own demerits namely that this time the famous trio have been reduced to cartoon characters. there is a lot more fun but at the same time they all go over the top. this was the beauty of the original. they were all simple and believable characters. but situational comedy has been replaced by sheer slapstick. another thing there are a lot of references to Brit film lock stock. that was a put off. also i think paresh rawal needs to give it a break. he is the funny man yet again and boy he is good at it, but i am sure i don't want to watch him again in a funny character in near future. on the flip side, the chemistry between the three was amazing. in fact its their constant bickering that keeps redeeming the film time after time. suniel shetty was alright, more like a catalyst for the other two superior actors do their job. akshay kumar, well, what can i say?? his unbridled zealousness raises the film by leaps and bounds. he was in his home territory and like paresh rawal will have you in splits. rest of the cast did their part well. on the whole a great film for escapism!"

"Its indeed first is always first but the 2nd one really shocked everyone as it was no where near 2nd part of Mallu movie Ramji Rao Speaking...and all the credit goes to Neeraj! Not to forget the Hera Pheri 1st where Paresh himself mentioning after receiving the best actor award...that the credit goes to Neeraj as Paresh is a total guju guy and due to Neeraj..he could project the marathi guy in 1st movie..all credit goes to the script writer and his perception as even the director directs but the key sense to the soul is the script writer..and I would say being a 2nd it really bags the credit for what it has done! A movie which will chuckle your bones and you don't worry about anything when you are driving back to home... Kudos to Neeraj the comedy king Cheers"

"The favourite comic trio of every Bollywood movie lover is back. They have done a splendid job again. Raju is more notorious, Shyam is a little foolish but Babu Bhaiyya has lost his mind completely!! It's an excellent movie but many say that it's not as good as the prequel but I would like to say that you definitely laughed more while watching this movie. Neeraj Vora is a good director. Nice dialogue delivery. The scenes repeated from the prequel are equally funny. This movie is in no way behind its prequel. This movie will surely remain a fan-favourite like its predecessor. Watch it again and again but it'll always make you laugh."
"When I went into this movie, I didn't know what to expect. I loved the first movie, and didn't think they could top it. But soon I realized this movie was better. Through out the whole movie I was laughing and having a great time.Paresh Rawal was of course the funniest character. I love all of his movies, and this was one of the best. His role as Baburao Apte was fantastic. Akshaye Kumar did the best acting. He fulfilled the role of Raju. And of course Sunil Shetty did great. But out of the three I liked Raju and Baburao more but that doesn't mean Shyam didn't do a great role.This movie was full of laughs, and the story had so many turns and twists. If you loved the first then you will love this. Even if you haven't seen the first one, watch this one anyway. I had a great time."

"i watched this movie last week and i would like to comment on it because the movie was really comedy and rib ticking stuff and i just fell down of my bed laughing badly on the last scenes .I didn't expect this much comedy which it was and i even didn't expect the verdict super-hit from the movie i thought it would be a stupid comedy like the ones these days but it was out of my expectations that the movie was one of my favorite Hindi comedy movies if you didn't watch this movie just watch it and you will be entertained by this great entertainer.but in the end there was a even a mystery which would rather be solved in pair Hera Peri part 3 laugh out loud"
"This film is an epic and absolute comedy with numerous rib-tickling moments.Akshay kumar,Paresh Rawal and Sunil shetty are perfect as the three leads who enter into trouble due to money's greed.Johny lever,Rajpal Yadav,Rimi sen,Sharat saxena,Manoj joshi and all other supporting actors add even more fun and comedy to the film.Last part evokes greatest laughter.ENJOY!"

"Phir Hera Pheri, the sequel to the most endearing cult-comedy of our times has released. I managed to watch it at a paid preview and here is my appraisal of different elements of the movie:Paresh Rawal as Baburao: Of course you start with him. Baburao is the real hero of the movie. Baburao Ganpatrao Apte is one of my (I think a lot of people will agree with me here) all-time favorite screen characters and Paresh currently one of the best actors around. The way he says \"Devaa Devaa, Utalerey\", only he can do it. He gets most of the best punchlines and as expected delivers them flawlessly. Whenever he is on screen, which he is most of the times, the smile hardly fades from your face. He overshadows all flaws in the movie and any blemishes from others. Outstanding work by Paresh Rawal!! What an actor! Rating <U+0096> AAkshay Kumar as Raju: Another fantastic job by him. He is fast becoming the new age comedy icon (if he has already not). There is never a dull moment with him around and he is just getting better with each film. After Mujhse Shaadi Karogi and Garam Masala another knockout performance by him. Check him out when he says \"Haaye Mujhe Sharm Aati Hai\" or in the maze scene during climax (which is a laugh riot) or the way he addresses Rimii with different names. Well done. Rating <U+0096> ASuneil Shetty as Shyam: He is the quintessential action guy who is trying his hand at other roles. His comedy roles like in Hera Pheri, Hulchul, Awara Pagal Deewana have been OK. He is not really that great an actor at comedy (On second thoughts in any role) but still somehow manages to hold his own. Here also he holds his own, but he needs to improve somehow or will be reduced to playing inconsequential character roles (irrespective of whether you change the spelling of your name or not). Here he is fine and actually some of his shortcomings are overshadowed by others. Rating <U+0096> B+Johnny Lever as Munna: One of the most popular comedians ever but he has not been in form in recent times. Here he is back in form as Munna a small time crook who wants to be big by robbing his earlier master. Some of his dialogues are funny. Only problem, his character could have been etched better. Rating <U+0096> B+Rajpal Yadav as Pappu: Another current favorite. Problem he does get much scope to prove his ability, but he has his moments. Rating <U+0096> BBipasha and Rimi: They don't get much scope at all. Bipasha looks hot throughout but I think that is what she was required to do as her acting skills are ahem<U+0085>Rimi on the other hand looks lost. Anyway not much was expected from their characters. Rating <U+0096> BSharad Saxena as Tiwari: Amazing performance!! As \"Totla Tiwari\" he is riot. He is the don whose money is conned (it's too complicated to explain here) and he expects our heroes to give it back. His character can't talk properly and his scenes with Baburao make you laugh your guts out. Rating <U+0096> AThere are a host of comedians in the movie. But most of the others don't get much scope as this is entirely the story of Baburao, Raju and Shyam. Suresh Menon (Munna's spy in Nanjibhai's camp) and Manoj Joshi (Kachra Seth) are very good. Rating <U+0096> B+ Bhojpuri superstar and one time Hindi film hero Ravi Kissen as Tiwari's henchman is also good Rating <U+0096> B+ Dinesh Hingoo, Milind Gunaji, Razzak Khan are OK. Sunil Pal is wasted. The gorilla and the \"man with no visible head\" (or Qutb Minar as Akshay puts it) are fun.Dialogues: Special mention for the dialogues. This movie has some fantastic dialogues. I won't spoil the fun by mentioning them here. Rating <U+0096> AMusic: Himesh Reshammiya can do no wrong currently. Aye Meri Zohrajbeen is a fantastic number and the video is, you've all seen it on music channels, fantastic. The others songs are time pass.Director: Satish Kaushik was supposed to do this movie but he pulled out and Neeraj Vora the writer has directed this. Considering his previous accomplishment as director (Khiladi 420 anyone), this is an amazing achievement. He has improved by leaps and bounds. It is never easy to direct a comedy that too a sequel and make a good job of it. A sequel always has to endure comparisons to the first part. This is not just another comedy but a sequel to Hera Pheri whose characters have now achieved cult status. There is never a dull moment. The movie moves at a very fast pace which gives you no time to brood over what is happening. Just enjoy the happenings as it is. What a job by Neeraj in this movie. Rating <U+0096> AThe movie has some amazing performances and dialogues. There are some references to the first part like the song \"Golmal Hain Bhai Sab Golmal Hai\" in the background or the \"Dhoti Utaale\" scene. But it is still enjoyable. Certain characters could have been avoided. One jarring note was the climax. I didn't like most of it much but people around me were in splits, maybe it was beyond my sensibilities. It will no doubt be compared to the first part. Some will like it and some will not. But don't let the comparisons deter you from watching the best comedy of the year so far. Overall, it is complete time pass. Rating <U+0096> B+The way the movie ends leaves scope for another sequel (Maybe called \"Ek Aur Hera Pheri). Can't have enough of Baburao, Raju and Shyam, so bring it on.Appraisal Rating Definitions: A -- Fantastic/Excellent B+ -- Very Good B -- Good B- -- OK C -- Poor"

The others songs are time pass.Director: Satish Kaushik was supposed to do this movie but he pulled out and Neeraj Vora the writer has directed this. Considering his previous accomplishment as director (Khiladi 420 anyone), this is an amazing achievement. He has improved by leaps and bounds. It is never easy to direct a comedy that too a sequel and make a good job of it. A sequel always has to endure comparisons to the first part. This is not just another comedy but a sequel to Hera Pheri whose characters have now achieved cult status. There is never a dull moment. The movie moves at a very fast pace which gives you no time to brood over what is happening. Just enjoy the happenings as it is. What a job by Neeraj in this movie. Rating <U+0096> AThe movie has some amazing performances and dialogues. There are some references to the first part like the song \"Golmal Hain Bhai Sab Golmal Hai\" in the background or the \"Dhoti Utaale\" scene. But it is still enjoyable. Certain characters could have been avoided. One jarring note was the climax. I didn't like most of it much but people around me were in splits, maybe it was beyond my sensibilities. It will no doubt be compared to the first part. Some will like it and some will not. But don't let the comparisons deter you from watching the best comedy of the year so far. Overall, it is complete time pass. Rating <U+0096> B+The way the movie ends leaves scope for another sequel (Maybe called \"Ek Aur Hera Pheri). Can't have enough of Baburao, Raju and Shyam, so bring it on.Appraisal Rating Definitions: A -- Fantastic/Excellent B+ -- Very Good B -- Good B- -- OK C -- Poor"

"This movie was a decently directed movie in the sense that it makes you laugh most of the times it was meant to, but no one can take over Priyadarshan. Certain scenes and dialogs were not funny at all like the ones when Babu Rao talks about his telephone in the beginning and when he comes to take the money in his chaul house to not believe it really is his home, also when Raju peeks into Johny Lever's apartment through the picture and several such scenes. Priyadarshan never includes lame comedy scenes or dialogs in his movies. Yet, the climax was a very Priyadarshan style where the comedy goes long into several groups fighting with each other like in Hera Pheri (part 1). Moreover, certain scenes and dialogs were repetitive. For instance, the two tall black villains added no substance what-so-ever and the Rs.1000 scene with Raju and his girl was over done the first time and thereon had the same concept repeating in subsequent scenes. Since most people only count the times they laugh to judge a comedy movie, I would say it's a great laughter movie and every couple of minutes, you find yourself either laughing or smiling. So if you haven't yet, go watch it!"

"It was really funny!! Baburoa played by Paresh Rawal was superb, and so was Akshay Kumars character, although Sunil Shetty'z character didn't shine through as much as in Hera Pheri!! The Chemistry between the three was great to watch, the characters haven't changed in the way they act they still get themselves into trouble and this time round they get into such a big mess!! I cant say that it is better then the first one because the Original is always the best!! Overall i believe that the film is good to watch and my comment is only based on the first time i watched it so If u ain't seen it GO 2 c it or get it on DVD when it releases because it definitely will have u kneeling over with laughter!!!"

"i saw this film last night and when it finished it got a big clapping send off from the audience. speaks volumes!! i think on the whole, with some reservations, this is more evenly paced and humorous than the original. however it does have its own demerits namely that this time the famous trio have been reduced to cartoon characters. there is a lot more fun but at the same time they all go over the top. this was the beauty of the original. they were all simple and believable characters. but situational comedy has been replaced by sheer slapstick. another thing there are a lot of references to Brit film lock stock. that was a put off. also i think paresh rawal needs to give it a break. he is the funny man yet again and boy he is good at it, but i am sure i don't want to watch him again in a funny character in near future. on the flip side, the chemistry between the three was amazing. in fact its their constant bickering that keeps redeeming the film time after time. suniel shetty was alright, more like a catalyst for the other two superior actors do their job. akshay kumar, well, what can i say?? his unbridled zealousness raises the film by leaps and bounds. he was in his home territory and like paresh rawal will have you in splits. rest of the cast did their part well. on the whole a great film for escapism!"

"Its indeed first is always first but the 2nd one really shocked everyone as it was no where near 2nd part of Mallu movie Ramji Rao Speaking...and all the credit goes to Neeraj! Not to forget the Hera Pheri 1st where Paresh himself mentioning after receiving the best actor award...that the credit goes to Neeraj as Paresh is a total guju guy and due to Neeraj..he could project the marathi guy in 1st movie..all credit goes to the script writer and his perception as even the director directs but the key sense to the soul is the script writer..and I would say being a 2nd it really bags the credit for what it has done! A movie which will chuckle your bones and you don't worry about anything when you are driving back to home... Kudos to Neeraj the comedy king Cheers"

"The favourite comic trio of every Bollywood movie lover is back. They have done a splendid job again. Raju is more notorious, Shyam is a little foolish but Babu Bhaiyya has lost his mind completely!! It's an excellent movie but many say that it's not as good as the prequel but I would like to say that you definitely laughed more while watching this movie. Neeraj Vora is a good director. Nice dialogue delivery. The scenes repeated from the prequel are equally funny. This movie is in no way behind its prequel. This movie will surely remain a fan-favourite like its predecessor. Watch it again and again but it'll always make you laugh."
"When I went into this movie, I didn't know what to expect. I loved the first movie, and didn't think they could top it. But soon I realized this movie was better. Through out the whole movie I was laughing and having a great time.Paresh Rawal was of course the funniest character. I love all of his movies, and this was one of the best. His role as Baburao Apte was fantastic. Akshaye Kumar did the best acting. He fulfilled the role of Raju. And of course Sunil Shetty did great. But out of the three I liked Raju and Baburao more but that doesn't mean Shyam didn't do a great role.This movie was full of laughs, and the story had so many turns and twists. If you loved the first then you will love this. Even if you haven't seen the first one, watch this one anyway. I had a great time."

"i watched this movie last week and i would like to comment on it because the movie was really comedy and rib ticking stuff and i just fell down of my bed laughing badly on the last scenes .I didn't expect this much comedy which it was and i even didn't expect the verdict super-hit from the movie i thought it would be a stupid comedy like the ones these days but it was out of my expectations that the movie was one of my favorite Hindi comedy movies if you didn't watch this movie just watch it and you will be entertained by this great entertainer.but in the end there was a even a mystery which would rather be solved in pair Hera Peri part 3 laugh out loud"
