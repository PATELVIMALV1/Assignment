    I play video games. I use virtual machines. I bought the 32GB DDR4 RAM, 512 GB NVME, 2080 Max Q design of this laptop. The keyboard is stunning and takes a little bit of getting used to. I love the fact they removed the Windows key from the WASD side of the keyboard. The onboard software packed with this is very nice and limited. Gives great functionality of the machine.There are 2 empty slots for additional NVME drives to add. I picked up some 970 EVO NVME's from Samsung.(NOTE) I have added a picture of what not to do. Please refer to this, otherwise you may think your drive bay is defective.No regrets from purchasing this rig. Also, as a bonus, the footprint is nearly identical to my 3 year old 15\" laptop. Even though this is a 17\". Also, this laptop is lighter and thinner on top of that. The only thing I may want is to get some sort of second skin to protect the fingerprint magnets that are this matte black. Which is very pretty btw.

    After several months of researching gaming laptops, I chose the MSI GS75 Stealth-093 based on the high-end specs (won't need to upgrade and it should run anything and everything), design, and reviews. I could not be happier with my choice for the following reasons: Prime 2-day delivery, triple boxed for protection, nicely packaged from MSI, beautiful 17\" display, SteelSeries Engine 3 MSI Per Key RGB Keyboard (multi-color back lit keyboard with different colors and lighting options), easy to type, track pad works great with lots of features, boot time is short and everything runs incredibly fast even with the highest game settings, and thin and light with a small form factor and the MSI utility software is excellent and very useful. The build and design quality are exceptional.Let me address some comments from other reviewers that may be helpful. Please consider that not every laptop can be perfect for everyone. The laptop has a high-end processor and dedicated graphics, so it will get need to circulate the air to cool down the electronic components. You will hear the fans when they run during heavy gaming to cool the high end CPU and graphics card, but it's not obnoxious. The speakers are good considering the laptop is extremely thin and light, but some may expect better. Although MSI reduced the thickness of the power adapter it would be nice if it was smaller. The bloatware is extremely minimal, which I very much appreciated (removed a few games that were probably bundled with Windows 10).  I find the screen opens and closes very smooth with the right amount of tension and the hinges are very sturdy.  The really bad 1 star reviews appear to be fake, probably from a competitor.I will update this review as I put in more time gaming and running other applications. At this point, I am 100% satisfied with the MSI GS75 Stealth laptop.

    The first thing i noticed about the MSI GS75 was the weight, at 4.8 pounds you would think no way this thing is going to perform like the heavy weights in its class. I was so wrong not only did it perform it didn't even break a sweat with COD4 and a 4K UHD movie running with excel heavy formulas being performed. 3 hrs of heavy use and the fans came on about 45 mins into the tasks. I love the black and gold design with the slim bezel and light weight, couldn't be happier. My only grip in the power cord easily slips out the charging port because of the weight and gauge of the cord.All an all the MSI GS75 - 093 is the best option for those wanting a super multi use laptop. 5 yr protection plan purchased also.

    Yep I'm a bit crazy about this laptop.  Personally I think its worth the money for it.  In fact I would say it is the best laptop I have ever owned.  Sure its expensive and maybe not more than 20% better than previous generation of laptops, but it is well made and its so nice having 17 inch screen on a thin and lite.  You could argue all about GPU performance isn't worth it, but to me its more than that with this machine.  It has everything I have ever wanted in a laptop and then some.  If it wasn't for the fact I have a kick ass desktop too, I would so replace the desktop with this laptop.

    Two units have failed. We were able to return the first to Amazon (which has a fabulous return policy) but the second one failed a week after the return period expired. My granddaughter, who received the machine from me as her birthday present, is contacting the manufacturer. We'll see what happens, but right now I would say: “Don’t buy this machine!”

    I received my MSI GS75 yesterday. For years I have been what most people would consider a nerd, or a techie. I've built computers and spent exorbitant amounts of money on unnecessary purchases in the tech field. This is no exception. When I turned this thing on it was nearly instant. I had a 2 year old lenovo yoga before this and it was great, but nowhere near the speed this thing is going to offer. I have already downloaded BFV and Civ 6. In Battlefield I am getting over 60 fps with ultra settings and RTX on. The new DLSS update seems to have worked like they said it would. In Civ the turns are insanely fast. I have spent years playing that game and spent even more years waiting in-between turns. Those days are gone ladies and gentlemen. I can't wait to see what else this thing has to offer in terms of performance, but as for the other qualities they're great too. The keys feel like the chiclet apple-style keys, they're great. The RGB on presets alone on the keyboard are impressive, although I set mine to a steady color immediately. I/O on this laptop is untouchable. There just aren't many thin and lights offering this amount of ports, I have more than enough. Lastly, the weight and form-factor. They cannot be any better. The laptop is slightly below five pounds and slightly above 6 pounds with the charger. It is thinner than my lenovo and barely heavier. The size of the screen is misleading, in the best possible. When you open GS75 (with your weakest finger) you are really able to appreciate the beauty and craftsmanship of this device. The bezels are pushed out to the furthest limits, allowing for maximum screen and very little bulk as far as carrying goes. I hope you guys all enjoy this thing as much as I do!

    I wrote a great review for this the day after I got it because it ran games great despite having a loud fan, but I am returning this today.I went to restart my system after installing some software and it got stuck on the logo while loading. I searched and found it is a really common issue, found some suggestions and was able to get it to start up again. Didn't actually use it at that point so it went back to sleep. When I went to wake it up it got stuck on the logo and the steps I took before to get it to work didn't work.I called MSI technical support (not amazon) and they gave me steps to get it to work. Which were basically what I had done on my own, but involved pushing the battery reset button twice (doing that on the bottom of the laptop for 30 sec with a 10 sec pause in between, holding the power button for about a minute, then powering it up while holding the delete key to enter bios and changing the boot priority). I used it all night, but the next morning it was stuck on the logo. Didn't feel like talking to tech support again or sending it in as I've only had it about a week and can just return it through amazon. Quite disappointed though as it was an amazing computer that was great to play any game I tried on it.

    Although I paid for a an over night shipping, this unit came in much later than then what when it's supposed to be delivered.  But, no points are taken off for that.  As I am a proud owner of a GS65 also from Best Buy RTX2060.What I like:Per key RGB is beautiful and stunning.  Pressing the Fn key lights up the available Fn key is cool.  The touch pad feels smooth (but too wide... no joke please).  The brand is good.  NVMe PCIe SSD is decent, far from the best, but I can live with that.  It's really thin, and without the compromise of no LAN or no camera.  Overall, a good looking notebook.What I dislike:No mDP, which is strange, because my GS65 has a mDP, and many of my friends have mDP to DP cable for external G-sync monitor.  I am forced to carry my own cable if I'm at friends house.  None of my friends has Type C display, nor Type C to DP cable.The windows button.  Although for gaming, I sometimes disable my windows button.  The windows button is on the right side of the space bar.  I mean I can get used it if I really try, but come on... GS65 and GS75 both RTX, and different KB layout?  And don't get me started with the \" | \" and \" \ \" keys.....  Yes.  KEYS.  Why is it so important to have a duplicate of this key cap.  No biggy.  I guess.  This is nip picking.  No points taken off.  It's just annoying.Minor light leak when system is totally black.  No points taken off.  I think it's typical.  It's just hard to fix when the bezel seems to be glued to the screen.  Leakage is not noticeable in normal usage on my system.My biggest complaint is not on MSI, but just this particular unit that I have.  System at or around idle, I saw 86 degree frequently, and fans constantly pulse between quiet and the next level.  Some of the lightest load, 6-7% CPU load, a second later, the fans start going bunkers.Running a simple 3DMARK11P, temp went up to  97-99 degree many times.  Granted, I shouldn't be running monitoring device while running benchmark.  It was because of the thermal throttling that I was experiencing that trigger my curiosity to monitor the temp.Add salt to the wound.  I would've been ok to take apart the system, and attempt to re-paste the system, as needed, had it not been the \"FACTORY SEAL\" covering one of the screw holes.  I don't want to void any factory warranty, should it come to that down the road.Looking at my other MSI notebook.  I would guess mine is just an one off for temperature issue.

    I tried the MSI GS65 Stealth with the 1070 max-q, and while I liked the design and loved the battery life I found it limited. The mother board was upside down and made upgrading a pain which was a serious problem since the storage was limited to 512 GBs. However they have improved on that slightly with the GS75. While the motherboard is still upside down so repasting and swapping ram is still a chore, it now has 3 M.2. drive slots accessible by just removing the bottom! Makes expanding your storage a breeze. I can not stress how important it is to make sure you get a build with 2 sticks of ram in it for dual channel. Unless you are very comfortable taking apart then putting back together laptops you don't want to do anything more to this than add SSDs, you have been warned. The performance while playing Anthem is amazing and my benchmarks are about what was expected. Nothing life changing, but much cooler than the GTX laptops and slightly better performance. Hopefully as RTX gains more traction and the drivers improve there will be a much more noticeable performance gain over RTX. However if you're an early adopter like me then you know how things go, and as such don't be surprised by the naysayers talking about your marginal gains. The real advantage here is all the power from GTX and more with lower thermals. No more laptops you can cook an egg on! Over all I love it, I just wish it was a bit more powerful hence the 4 stars instead of 5. Still i highly recommend this to anyone who doesn't mind dropping 3K on a thin and light desktop replacement.

    Aesthetics and Gaming performanceBeautiful Laptop, there's no denial there. The customization and colors of the keyboard are a wonderful bonus. It takes some time getting used to it, but once you're used it rocks. Strangely I don't get as many compliments on the \"RTX\" series sticker as opposed to my \"Disco\" preset keyboard lighting. Go figure.  The graphics card speaks for itself in many ways and lives up to the expectation, in my opinion. There's still some faults, but optimization of the 2080 max q will come with time. The big thing here is that you can run any game on max settings and usually get between 60 - 100fps. The even bigger thing here is the amount of all that hardware in such a slim laptop. It definitely overpowers desktops in terms of performance on gaming. I don't think we need to get to much into gaming, as you can look at the hardware and just imagine the FPS on Ultra setting.Upgrades - I bought a Samsung 970 Evo 1TB SSD and Migrated then changed the boot BIOS to that, and have kept original 512 SSD as storage. Overkill? Why yes, yes it is. But in addition to gaming, I need all the space for apps like Unity 3D, Android Studio , Oracle, Eclipse, etc etc. So I needed more than the stock 512 IMO.Start up time? What's that?Screen quality is beautiful. I mean are there better resolutions? Yes. Will you notice? Not really.Portability - I bought an Anti-Theft backpack advertised as 17\" along side this and it fits, rather too tight , into it. I still haven't gotten passed the treat it like it's made of super thin glass phase. But the portability is easier than my 15 inch Toshiba, and with the thin size can slip easily into 17 inch bags/sleeves.Is it worth 3,000? Why yes, yes it is. Do not regret my purchase, and will go as far as saying this has opened my eyes to MSI, to which I approached with caution before. Will definitely update within a couple months to see how everything's going.Another quick note - When I'm playing a resource heavy game, and have the fans on full blast(If you didn't know you can change the speed of the fans from within the dragon center) it does a wonderful job of keeping everything cool.SIDE NOTE - if you are upgrading the storage, the M2 slots already have the screws, but only a single pair SO DON'T LOSE THEM.Maybe worth mentioning? - Start up to login takes about 15-20 seconds. And half the time takes less than that.Honestly this laptop can take whatever you hurl at it.Stop reading and buy.

Sure its expensive and maybe not more than 20% better than previous generation of laptops, but it is well made and its so nice having 17 inch screen on a thin and lite.  You could argue all about GPU performance isn't worth it, but to me its more than that with this machine.  It has everything I have ever wanted in a laptop and then some.  If it wasn't for the fact I have a kick ass desktop too, I would so replace the desktop with this laptop.

    Two units have failed. We were able to return the first to Amazon (which has a fabulous return policy) but the second one failed a week after the return period expired. My granddaughter, who received the machine from me as her birthday present, is contacting the manufacturer. We'll see what happens, but right now I would say: “Don’t buy this machine!”

    I received my MSI GS75 yesterday. For years I have been what most people would consider a nerd, or a techie. I've built computers and spent exorbitant amounts of money on unnecessary purchases in the tech field. This is no exception. When I turned this thing on it was nearly instant. I had a 2 year old lenovo yoga before this and it was great, but nowhere near the speed this thing is going to offer. I have already downloaded BFV and Civ 6. In Battlefield I am getting over 60 fps with ultra settings and RTX on. The new DLSS update seems to have worked like they said it would. In Civ the turns are insanely fast. I have spent years playing that game and spent even more years waiting in-between turns. Those days are gone ladies and gentlemen. I can't wait to see what else this thing has to offer in terms of performance, but as for the other qualities they're great too. The keys feel like the chiclet apple-style keys, they're great. The RGB on presets alone on the keyboard are impressive, although I set mine to a steady color immediately. I/O on this laptop is untouchable. There just aren't many thin and lights offering this amount of ports, I have more than enough. Lastly, the weight and form-factor. They cannot be any better. The laptop is slightly below five pounds and slightly above 6 pounds with the charger. It is thinner than my lenovo and barely heavier. The size of the screen is misleading, in the best possible. When you open GS75 (with your weakest finger) you are really able to appreciate the beauty and craftsmanship of this device. The bezels are pushed out to the furthest limits, allowing for maximum screen and very little bulk as far as carrying goes. I hope you guys all enjoy this thing as much as I do!

    I wrote a great review for this the day after I got it because it ran games great despite having a loud fan, but I am returning this today.I went to restart my system after installing some software and it got stuck on the logo while loading. I searched and found it is a really common issue, found some suggestions and was able to get it to start up again. Didn't actually use it at that point so it went back to sleep. When I went to wake it up it got stuck on the logo and the steps I took before to get it to work didn't work.I called MSI technical support (not amazon) and they gave me steps to get it to work. Which were basically what I had done on my own, but involved pushing the battery reset button twice (doing that on the bottom of the laptop for 30 sec with a 10 sec pause in between, holding the power button for about a minute, then powering it up while holding the delete key to enter bios and changing the boot priority). I used it all night, but the next morning it was stuck on the logo. Didn't feel like talking to tech support again or sending it in as I've only had it about a week and can just return it through amazon. Quite disappointed though as it was an amazing computer that was great to play any game I tried on it.

    Although I paid for a an over night shipping, this unit came in much later than then what when it's supposed to be delivered.  But, no points are taken off for that.  As I am a proud owner of a GS65 also from Best Buy RTX2060.What I like:Per key RGB is beautiful and stunning.  Pressing the Fn key lights up the available Fn key is cool.  The touch pad feels smooth (but too wide... no joke please).  The brand is good.  NVMe PCIe SSD is decent, far from the best, but I can live with that.  It's really thin, and without the compromise of no LAN or no camera.  Overall, a good looking notebook.What I dislike:No mDP, which is strange, because my GS65 has a mDP, and many of my friends have mDP to DP cable for external G-sync monitor.  I am forced to carry my own cable if I'm at friends house.  None of my friends has Type C display, nor Type C to DP cable.The windows button.  Although for gaming, I sometimes disable my windows button.  The windows button is on the right side of the space bar.  I mean I can get used it if I really try, but come on... GS65 and GS75 both RTX, and different KB layout?  And don't get me started with the \" | \" and \" \ \" keys.....  Yes.  KEYS.  Why is it so important to have a duplicate of this key cap.  No biggy.  I guess.  This is nip picking.  No points taken off.  It's just annoying.Minor light leak when system is totally black.  No points taken off.  I think it's typical.  It's just hard to fix when the bezel seems to be glued to the screen.  Leakage is not noticeable in normal usage on my system.My biggest complaint is not on MSI, but just this particular unit that I have.  System at or around idle, I saw 86 degree frequently, and fans constantly pulse between quiet and the next level.  Some of the lightest load, 6-7% CPU load, a second later, the fans start going bunkers.Running a simple 3DMARK11P, temp went up to  97-99 degree many times.  Granted, I shouldn't be running monitoring device while running benchmark.  It was because of the thermal throttling that I was experiencing that trigger my curiosity to monitor the temp.Add salt to the wound.  I would've been ok to take apart the system, and attempt to re-paste the system, as needed, had it not been the \"FACTORY SEAL\" covering one of the screw holes.  I don't want to void any factory warranty, should it come to that down the road.Looking at my other MSI notebook.  I would guess mine is just an one off for temperature issue.

    I tried the MSI GS65 Stealth with the 1070 max-q, and while I liked the design and loved the battery life I found it limited. The mother board was upside down and made upgrading a pain which was a serious problem since the storage was limited to 512 GBs. However they have improved on that slightly with the GS75. While the motherboard is still upside down so repasting and swapping ram is still a chore, it now has 3 M.2. drive slots accessible by just removing the bottom! Makes expanding your storage a breeze. I can not stress how important it is to make sure you get a build with 2 sticks of ram in it for dual channel. Unless you are very comfortable taking apart then putting back together laptops you don't want to do anything more to this than add SSDs, you have been warned. The performance while playing Anthem is amazing and my benchmarks are about what was expected. Nothing life changing, but much cooler than the GTX laptops and slightly better performance. Hopefully as RTX gains more traction and the drivers improve there will be a much more noticeable performance gain over RTX. However if you're an early adopter like me then you know how things go, and as such don't be surprised by the naysayers talking about your marginal gains. The real advantage here is all the power from GTX and more with lower thermals. No more laptops you can cook an egg on! Over all I love it, I just wish it was a bit more powerful hence the 4 stars instead of 5. Still i highly recommend this to anyone who doesn't mind dropping 3K on a thin and light desktop replacement.

    Aesthetics and Gaming performanceBeautiful Laptop, there's no denial there. The customization and colors of the keyboard are a wonderful bonus. It takes some time getting used to it, but once you're used it rocks. Strangely I don't get as many compliments on the \"RTX\" series sticker as opposed to my \"Disco\" preset keyboard lighting. Go figure.  The graphics card speaks for itself in many ways and lives up to the expectation, in my opinion. There's still some faults, but optimization of the 2080 max q will come with time. The big thing here is that you can run any game on max settings and usually get between 60 - 100fps. The even bigger thing here is the amount of all that hardware in such a slim laptop. It definitely overpowers desktops in terms of performance on gaming. I don't think we need to get to much into gaming, as you can look at the hardware and just imagine the FPS on Ultra setting.Upgrades - I bought a Samsung 970 Evo 1TB SSD and Migrated then changed the boot BIOS to that, and have kept original 512 SSD as storage. Overkill? Why yes, yes it is. But in addition to gaming, I need all the space for apps like Unity 3D, Android Studio , Oracle, Eclipse, etc etc. So I needed more than the stock 512 IMO.Start up time? What's that?Screen quality is beautiful. I mean are there better resolutions? Yes. Will you notice? Not really.Portability - I bought an Anti-Theft backpack advertised as 17\" along side this and it fits, rather too tight , into it. I still haven't gotten passed the treat it like it's made of super thin glass phase. But the portability is easier than my 15 inch Toshiba, and with the thin size can slip easily into 17 inch bags/sleeves.Is it worth 3,000? Why yes, yes it is. Do not regret my purchase, and will go as far as saying this has opened my eyes to MSI, to which I approached with caution before. Will definitely update within a couple months to see how everything's going.Another quick note - When I'm playing a resource heavy game, and have the fans on full blast(If you didn't know you can change the speed of the fans from within the dragon center) it does a wonderful job of keeping everything cool.SIDE NOTE - if you are upgrading the storage, the M2 slots already have the screws, but only a single pair SO DON'T LOSE THEM.Maybe worth mentioning? - Start up to login takes about 15-20 seconds. And half the time takes less than that.Honestly this laptop can take whatever you hurl at it.Stop reading and buy.

    I play video games. I use virtual machines. I bought the 32GB DDR4 RAM, 512 GB NVME, 2080 Max Q design of this laptop. The keyboard is stunning and takes a little bit of getting used to. I love the fact they removed the Windows key from the WASD side of the keyboard. The onboard software packed with this is very nice and limited. Gives great functionality of the machine.There are 2 empty slots for additional NVME drives to add. I picked up some 970 EVO NVME's from Samsung.(NOTE) I have added a picture of what not to do. Please refer to this, otherwise you may think your drive bay is defective.No regrets from purchasing this rig. Also, as a bonus, the footprint is nearly identical to my 3 year old 15\" laptop. Even though this is a 17\". Also, this laptop is lighter and thinner on top of that. The only thing I may want is to get some sort of second skin to protect the fingerprint magnets that are this matte black. Which is very pretty btw.

    After several months of researching gaming laptops, I chose the MSI GS75 Stealth-093 based on the high-end specs (won't need to upgrade and it should run anything and everything), design, and reviews. I could not be happier with my choice for the following reasons: Prime 2-day delivery, triple boxed for protection, nicely packaged from MSI, beautiful 17\" display, SteelSeries Engine 3 MSI Per Key RGB Keyboard (multi-color back lit keyboard with different colors and lighting options), easy to type, track pad works great with lots of features, boot time is short and everything runs incredibly fast even with the highest game settings, and thin and light with a small form factor and the MSI utility software is excellent and very useful. The build and design quality are exceptional.Let me address some comments from other reviewers that may be helpful. Please consider that not every laptop can be perfect for everyone. The laptop has a high-end processor and dedicated graphics, so it will get need to circulate the air to cool down the electronic components. You will hear the fans when they run during heavy gaming to cool the high end CPU and graphics card, but it's not obnoxious. The speakers are good considering the laptop is extremely thin and light, but some may expect better. Although MSI reduced the thickness of the power adapter it would be nice if it was smaller. The bloatware is extremely minimal, which I very much appreciated (removed a few games that were probably bundled with Windows 10).  I find the screen opens and closes very smooth with the right amount of tension and the hinges are very sturdy.  The really bad 1 star reviews appear to be fake, probably from a competitor.I will update this review as I put in more time gaming and running other applications. At this point, I am 100% satisfied with the MSI GS75 Stealth laptop.

    The first thing i noticed about the MSI GS75 was the weight, at 4.8 pounds you would think no way this thing is going to perform like the heavy weights in its class. I was so wrong not only did it perform it didn't even break a sweat with COD4 and a 4K UHD movie running with excel heavy formulas being performed. 3 hrs of heavy use and the fans came on about 45 mins into the tasks. I love the black and gold design with the slim bezel and light weight, couldn't be happier. My only grip in the power cord easily slips out the charging port because of the weight and gauge of the cord.All an all the MSI GS75 - 093 is the best option for those wanting a super multi use laptop. 5 yr protection plan purchased also.

Didn't feel like talking to tech support again or sending it in as I've only had it about a week and can just return it through amazon. Quite disappointed though as it was an amazing computer that was great to play any game I tried on it.

    Although I paid for a an over night shipping, this unit came in much later than then what when it's supposed to be delivered.  But, no points are taken off for that.  As I am a proud owner of a GS65 also from Best Buy RTX2060.What I like:Per key RGB is beautiful and stunning.  Pressing the Fn key lights up the available Fn key is cool.  The touch pad feels smooth (but too wide... no joke please).  The brand is good.  NVMe PCIe SSD is decent, far from the best, but I can live with that.  It's really thin, and without the compromise of no LAN or no camera.  Overall, a good looking notebook.What I dislike:No mDP, which is strange, because my GS65 has a mDP, and many of my friends have mDP to DP cable for external G-sync monitor.  I am forced to carry my own cable if I'm at friends house.  None of my friends has Type C display, nor Type C to DP cable.The windows button.  Although for gaming, I sometimes disable my windows button.  The windows button is on the right side of the space bar.  I mean I can get used it if I really try, but come on... GS65 and GS75 both RTX, and different KB layout?  And don't get me started with the \" | \" and \" \ \" keys.....  Yes.  KEYS.  Why is it so important to have a duplicate of this key cap.  No biggy.  I guess.  This is nip picking.  No points taken off.  It's just annoying.Minor light leak when system is totally black.  No points taken off.  I think it's typical.  It's just hard to fix when the bezel seems to be glued to the screen.  Leakage is not noticeable in normal usage on my system.My biggest complaint is not on MSI, but just this particular unit that I have.  System at or around idle, I saw 86 degree frequently, and fans constantly pulse between quiet and the next level.  Some of the lightest load, 6-7% CPU load, a second later, the fans start going bunkers.Running a simple 3DMARK11P, temp went up to  97-99 degree many times.  Granted, I shouldn't be running monitoring device while running benchmark.  It was because of the thermal throttling that I was experiencing that trigger my curiosity to monitor the temp.Add salt to the wound.  I would've been ok to take apart the system, and attempt to re-paste the system, as needed, had it not been the \"FACTORY SEAL\" covering one of the screw holes.  I don't want to void any factory warranty, should it come to that down the road.Looking at my other MSI notebook.  I would guess mine is just an one off for temperature issue.

    I tried the MSI GS65 Stealth with the 1070 max-q, and while I liked the design and loved the battery life I found it limited. The mother board was upside down and made upgrading a pain which was a serious problem since the storage was limited to 512 GBs. However they have improved on that slightly with the GS75. While the motherboard is still upside down so repasting and swapping ram is still a chore, it now has 3 M.2. drive slots accessible by just removing the bottom! Makes expanding your storage a breeze. I can not stress how important it is to make sure you get a build with 2 sticks of ram in it for dual channel. Unless you are very comfortable taking apart then putting back together laptops you don't want to do anything more to this than add SSDs, you have been warned. The performance while playing Anthem is amazing and my benchmarks are about what was expected. Nothing life changing, but much cooler than the GTX laptops and slightly better performance. Hopefully as RTX gains more traction and the drivers improve there will be a much more noticeable performance gain over RTX. However if you're an early adopter like me then you know how things go, and as such don't be surprised by the naysayers talking about your marginal gains. The real advantage here is all the power from GTX and more with lower thermals. No more laptops you can cook an egg on! Over all I love it, I just wish it was a bit more powerful hence the 4 stars instead of 5. Still i highly recommend this to anyone who doesn't mind dropping 3K on a thin and light desktop replacement.

    Aesthetics and Gaming performanceBeautiful Laptop, there's no denial there. The customization and colors of the keyboard are a wonderful bonus. It takes some time getting used to it, but once you're used it rocks. Strangely I don't get as many compliments on the \"RTX\" series sticker as opposed to my \"Disco\" preset keyboard lighting. Go figure.  The graphics card speaks for itself in many ways and lives up to the expectation, in my opinion. There's still some faults, but optimization of the 2080 max q will come with time. The big thing here is that you can run any game on max settings and usually get between 60 - 100fps. The even bigger thing here is the amount of all that hardware in such a slim laptop. It definitely overpowers desktops in terms of performance on gaming. I don't think we need to get to much into gaming, as you can look at the hardware and just imagine the FPS on Ultra setting.Upgrades - I bought a Samsung 970 Evo 1TB SSD and Migrated then changed the boot BIOS to that, and have kept original 512 SSD as storage. Overkill? Why yes, yes it is. But in addition to gaming, I need all the space for apps like Unity 3D, Android Studio , Oracle, Eclipse, etc etc. So I needed more than the stock 512 IMO.Start up time? What's that?Screen quality is beautiful. I mean are there better resolutions? Yes. Will you notice? Not really.Portability - I bought an Anti-Theft backpack advertised as 17\" along side this and it fits, rather too tight , into it. I still haven't gotten passed the treat it like it's made of super thin glass phase. But the portability is easier than my 15 inch Toshiba, and with the thin size can slip easily into 17 inch bags/sleeves.Is it worth 3,000? Why yes, yes it is. Do not regret my purchase, and will go as far as saying this has opened my eyes to MSI, to which I approached with caution before. Will definitely update within a couple months to see how everything's going.Another quick note - When I'm playing a resource heavy game, and have the fans on full blast(If you didn't know you can change the speed of the fans from within the dragon center) it does a wonderful job of keeping everything cool.SIDE NOTE - if you are upgrading the storage, the M2 slots already have the screws, but only a single pair SO DON'T LOSE THEM.Maybe worth mentioning? - Start up to login takes about 15-20 seconds. And half the time takes less than that.Honestly this laptop can take whatever you hurl at it.Stop reading and buy.

    I play video games. I use virtual machines. I bought the 32GB DDR4 RAM, 512 GB NVME, 2080 Max Q design of this laptop. The keyboard is stunning and takes a little bit of getting used to. I love the fact they removed the Windows key from the WASD side of the keyboard. The onboard software packed with this is very nice and limited. Gives great functionality of the machine.There are 2 empty slots for additional NVME drives to add. I picked up some 970 EVO NVME's from Samsung.(NOTE) I have added a picture of what not to do. Please refer to this, otherwise you may think your drive bay is defective.No regrets from purchasing this rig. Also, as a bonus, the footprint is nearly identical to my 3 year old 15\" laptop. Even though this is a 17\". Also, this laptop is lighter and thinner on top of that. The only thing I may want is to get some sort of second skin to protect the fingerprint magnets that are this matte black. Which is very pretty btw.

    After several months of researching gaming laptops, I chose the MSI GS75 Stealth-093 based on the high-end specs (won't need to upgrade and it should run anything and everything), design, and reviews. I could not be happier with my choice for the following reasons: Prime 2-day delivery, triple boxed for protection, nicely packaged from MSI, beautiful 17\" display, SteelSeries Engine 3 MSI Per Key RGB Keyboard (multi-color back lit keyboard with different colors and lighting options), easy to type, track pad works great with lots of features, boot time is short and everything runs incredibly fast even with the highest game settings, and thin and light with a small form factor and the MSI utility software is excellent and very useful. The build and design quality are exceptional.Let me address some comments from other reviewers that may be helpful. Please consider that not every laptop can be perfect for everyone. The laptop has a high-end processor and dedicated graphics, so it will get need to circulate the air to cool down the electronic components. You will hear the fans when they run during heavy gaming to cool the high end CPU and graphics card, but it's not obnoxious. The speakers are good considering the laptop is extremely thin and light, but some may expect better. Although MSI reduced the thickness of the power adapter it would be nice if it was smaller. The bloatware is extremely minimal, which I very much appreciated (removed a few games that were probably bundled with Windows 10).  I find the screen opens and closes very smooth with the right amount of tension and the hinges are very sturdy.  The really bad 1 star reviews appear to be fake, probably from a competitor.I will update this review as I put in more time gaming and running other applications. At this point, I am 100% satisfied with the MSI GS75 Stealth laptop.

    The first thing i noticed about the MSI GS75 was the weight, at 4.8 pounds you would think no way this thing is going to perform like the heavy weights in its class. I was so wrong not only did it perform it didn't even break a sweat with COD4 and a 4K UHD movie running with excel heavy formulas being performed. 3 hrs of heavy use and the fans came on about 45 mins into the tasks. I love the black and gold design with the slim bezel and light weight, couldn't be happier. My only grip in the power cord easily slips out the charging port because of the weight and gauge of the cord.All an all the MSI GS75 - 093 is the best option for those wanting a super multi use laptop. 5 yr protection plan purchased also.

    Yep I'm a bit crazy about this laptop.  Personally I think its worth the money for it.  In fact I would say it is the best laptop I have ever owned.  Sure its expensive and maybe not more than 20% better than previous generation of laptops, but it is well made and its so nice having 17 inch screen on a thin and lite.  You could argue all about GPU performance isn't worth it, but to me its more than that with this machine.  It has everything I have ever wanted in a laptop and then some.  If it wasn't for the fact I have a kick ass desktop too, I would so replace the desktop with this laptop.

    Two units have failed. We were able to return the first to Amazon (which has a fabulous return policy) but the second one failed a week after the return period expired. My granddaughter, who received the machine from me as her birthday present, is contacting the manufacturer. We'll see what happens, but right now I would say: “Don’t buy this machine!”

    I received my MSI GS75 yesterday. For years I have been what most people would consider a nerd, or a techie. I've built computers and spent exorbitant amounts of money on unnecessary purchases in the tech field. This is no exception. When I turned this thing on it was nearly instant. I had a 2 year old lenovo yoga before this and it was great, but nowhere near the speed this thing is going to offer. I have already downloaded BFV and Civ 6. In Battlefield I am getting over 60 fps with ultra settings and RTX on. The new DLSS update seems to have worked like they said it would. In Civ the turns are insanely fast. I have spent years playing that game and spent even more years waiting in-between turns. Those days are gone ladies and gentlemen. I can't wait to see what else this thing has to offer in terms of performance, but as for the other qualities they're great too. The keys feel like the chiclet apple-style keys, they're great. The RGB on presets alone on the keyboard are impressive, although I set mine to a steady color immediately. I/O on this laptop is untouchable. There just aren't many thin and lights offering this amount of ports, I have more than enough. Lastly, the weight and form-factor. They cannot be any better. The laptop is slightly below five pounds and slightly above 6 pounds with the charger. It is thinner than my lenovo and barely heavier. The size of the screen is misleading, in the best possible. When you open GS75 (with your weakest finger) you are really able to appreciate the beauty and craftsmanship of this device. The bezels are pushed out to the furthest limits, allowing for maximum screen and very little bulk as far as carrying goes. I hope you guys all enjoy this thing as much as I do!

    I wrote a great review for this the day after I got it because it ran games great despite having a loud fan, but I am returning this today.I went to restart my system after installing some software and it got stuck on the logo while loading. I searched and found it is a really common issue, found some suggestions and was able to get it to start up again. Didn't actually use it at that point so it went back to sleep. When I went to wake it up it got stuck on the logo and the steps I took before to get it to work didn't work.I called MSI technical support (not amazon) and they gave me steps to get it to work. Which were basically what I had done on my own, but involved pushing the battery reset button twice (doing that on the bottom of the laptop for 30 sec with a 10 sec pause in between, holding the power button for about a minute, then powering it up while holding the delete key to enter bios and changing the boot priority).

While the motherboard is still upside down so repasting and swapping ram is still a chore, it now has 3 M.2. drive slots accessible by just removing the bottom! Makes expanding your storage a breeze. I can not stress how important it is to make sure you get a build with 2 sticks of ram in it for dual channel. Unless you are very comfortable taking apart then putting back together laptops you don't want to do anything more to this than add SSDs, you have been warned. The performance while playing Anthem is amazing and my benchmarks are about what was expected. Nothing life changing, but much cooler than the GTX laptops and slightly better performance. Hopefully as RTX gains more traction and the drivers improve there will be a much more noticeable performance gain over RTX. However if you're an early adopter like me then you know how things go, and as such don't be surprised by the naysayers talking about your marginal gains. The real advantage here is all the power from GTX and more with lower thermals. No more laptops you can cook an egg on! Over all I love it, I just wish it was a bit more powerful hence the 4 stars instead of 5. Still i highly recommend this to anyone who doesn't mind dropping 3K on a thin and light desktop replacement.

    Aesthetics and Gaming performanceBeautiful Laptop, there's no denial there. The customization and colors of the keyboard are a wonderful bonus. It takes some time getting used to it, but once you're used it rocks. Strangely I don't get as many compliments on the \"RTX\" series sticker as opposed to my \"Disco\" preset keyboard lighting. Go figure.  The graphics card speaks for itself in many ways and lives up to the expectation, in my opinion. There's still some faults, but optimization of the 2080 max q will come with time. The big thing here is that you can run any game on max settings and usually get between 60 - 100fps. The even bigger thing here is the amount of all that hardware in such a slim laptop. It definitely overpowers desktops in terms of performance on gaming. I don't think we need to get to much into gaming, as you can look at the hardware and just imagine the FPS on Ultra setting.Upgrades - I bought a Samsung 970 Evo 1TB SSD and Migrated then changed the boot BIOS to that, and have kept original 512 SSD as storage. Overkill? Why yes, yes it is. But in addition to gaming, I need all the space for apps like Unity 3D, Android Studio , Oracle, Eclipse, etc etc. So I needed more than the stock 512 IMO.Start up time? What's that?Screen quality is beautiful. I mean are there better resolutions? Yes. Will you notice? Not really.Portability - I bought an Anti-Theft backpack advertised as 17\" along side this and it fits, rather too tight , into it. I still haven't gotten passed the treat it like it's made of super thin glass phase. But the portability is easier than my 15 inch Toshiba, and with the thin size can slip easily into 17 inch bags/sleeves.Is it worth 3,000? Why yes, yes it is. Do not regret my purchase, and will go as far as saying this has opened my eyes to MSI, to which I approached with caution before. Will definitely update within a couple months to see how everything's going.Another quick note - When I'm playing a resource heavy game, and have the fans on full blast(If you didn't know you can change the speed of the fans from within the dragon center) it does a wonderful job of keeping everything cool.SIDE NOTE - if you are upgrading the storage, the M2 slots already have the screws, but only a single pair SO DON'T LOSE THEM.Maybe worth mentioning? - Start up to login takes about 15-20 seconds. And half the time takes less than that.Honestly this laptop can take whatever you hurl at it.Stop reading and buy.

    I play video games. I use virtual machines. I bought the 32GB DDR4 RAM, 512 GB NVME, 2080 Max Q design of this laptop. The keyboard is stunning and takes a little bit of getting used to. I love the fact they removed the Windows key from the WASD side of the keyboard. The onboard software packed with this is very nice and limited. Gives great functionality of the machine.There are 2 empty slots for additional NVME drives to add. I picked up some 970 EVO NVME's from Samsung.(NOTE) I have added a picture of what not to do. Please refer to this, otherwise you may think your drive bay is defective.No regrets from purchasing this rig. Also, as a bonus, the footprint is nearly identical to my 3 year old 15\" laptop. Even though this is a 17\". Also, this laptop is lighter and thinner on top of that. The only thing I may want is to get some sort of second skin to protect the fingerprint magnets that are this matte black. Which is very pretty btw.

    After several months of researching gaming laptops, I chose the MSI GS75 Stealth-093 based on the high-end specs (won't need to upgrade and it should run anything and everything), design, and reviews. I could not be happier with my choice for the following reasons: Prime 2-day delivery, triple boxed for protection, nicely packaged from MSI, beautiful 17\" display, SteelSeries Engine 3 MSI Per Key RGB Keyboard (multi-color back lit keyboard with different colors and lighting options), easy to type, track pad works great with lots of features, boot time is short and everything runs incredibly fast even with the highest game settings, and thin and light with a small form factor and the MSI utility software is excellent and very useful. The build and design quality are exceptional.Let me address some comments from other reviewers that may be helpful. Please consider that not every laptop can be perfect for everyone. The laptop has a high-end processor and dedicated graphics, so it will get need to circulate the air to cool down the electronic components. You will hear the fans when they run during heavy gaming to cool the high end CPU and graphics card, but it's not obnoxious. The speakers are good considering the laptop is extremely thin and light, but some may expect better. Although MSI reduced the thickness of the power adapter it would be nice if it was smaller. The bloatware is extremely minimal, which I very much appreciated (removed a few games that were probably bundled with Windows 10).  I find the screen opens and closes very smooth with the right amount of tension and the hinges are very sturdy.  The really bad 1 star reviews appear to be fake, probably from a competitor.I will update this review as I put in more time gaming and running other applications. At this point, I am 100% satisfied with the MSI GS75 Stealth laptop.

    The first thing i noticed about the MSI GS75 was the weight, at 4.8 pounds you would think no way this thing is going to perform like the heavy weights in its class. I was so wrong not only did it perform it didn't even break a sweat with COD4 and a 4K UHD movie running with excel heavy formulas being performed. 3 hrs of heavy use and the fans came on about 45 mins into the tasks. I love the black and gold design with the slim bezel and light weight, couldn't be happier. My only grip in the power cord easily slips out the charging port because of the weight and gauge of the cord.All an all the MSI GS75 - 093 is the best option for those wanting a super multi use laptop. 5 yr protection plan purchased also.

    Yep I'm a bit crazy about this laptop.  Personally I think its worth the money for it.  In fact I would say it is the best laptop I have ever owned.  Sure its expensive and maybe not more than 20% better than previous generation of laptops, but it is well made and its so nice having 17 inch screen on a thin and lite.  You could argue all about GPU performance isn't worth it, but to me its more than that with this machine.  It has everything I have ever wanted in a laptop and then some.  If it wasn't for the fact I have a kick ass desktop too, I would so replace the desktop with this laptop.

    Two units have failed. We were able to return the first to Amazon (which has a fabulous return policy) but the second one failed a week after the return period expired. My granddaughter, who received the machine from me as her birthday present, is contacting the manufacturer. We'll see what happens, but right now I would say: “Don’t buy this machine!”

    I received my MSI GS75 yesterday. For years I have been what most people would consider a nerd, or a techie. I've built computers and spent exorbitant amounts of money on unnecessary purchases in the tech field. This is no exception. When I turned this thing on it was nearly instant. I had a 2 year old lenovo yoga before this and it was great, but nowhere near the speed this thing is going to offer. I have already downloaded BFV and Civ 6. In Battlefield I am getting over 60 fps with ultra settings and RTX on. The new DLSS update seems to have worked like they said it would. In Civ the turns are insanely fast. I have spent years playing that game and spent even more years waiting in-between turns. Those days are gone ladies and gentlemen. I can't wait to see what else this thing has to offer in terms of performance, but as for the other qualities they're great too. The keys feel like the chiclet apple-style keys, they're great. The RGB on presets alone on the keyboard are impressive, although I set mine to a steady color immediately. I/O on this laptop is untouchable. There just aren't many thin and lights offering this amount of ports, I have more than enough. Lastly, the weight and form-factor. They cannot be any better. The laptop is slightly below five pounds and slightly above 6 pounds with the charger. It is thinner than my lenovo and barely heavier. The size of the screen is misleading, in the best possible. When you open GS75 (with your weakest finger) you are really able to appreciate the beauty and craftsmanship of this device. The bezels are pushed out to the furthest limits, allowing for maximum screen and very little bulk as far as carrying goes. I hope you guys all enjoy this thing as much as I do!

    I wrote a great review for this the day after I got it because it ran games great despite having a loud fan, but I am returning this today.I went to restart my system after installing some software and it got stuck on the logo while loading. I searched and found it is a really common issue, found some suggestions and was able to get it to start up again. Didn't actually use it at that point so it went back to sleep. When I went to wake it up it got stuck on the logo and the steps I took before to get it to work didn't work.I called MSI technical support (not amazon) and they gave me steps to get it to work. Which were basically what I had done on my own, but involved pushing the battery reset button twice (doing that on the bottom of the laptop for 30 sec with a 10 sec pause in between, holding the power button for about a minute, then powering it up while holding the delete key to enter bios and changing the boot priority). I used it all night, but the next morning it was stuck on the logo. Didn't feel like talking to tech support again or sending it in as I've only had it about a week and can just return it through amazon. Quite disappointed though as it was an amazing computer that was great to play any game I tried on it.

    Although I paid for a an over night shipping, this unit came in much later than then what when it's supposed to be delivered.  But, no points are taken off for that.  As I am a proud owner of a GS65 also from Best Buy RTX2060.What I like:Per key RGB is beautiful and stunning.  Pressing the Fn key lights up the available Fn key is cool.  The touch pad feels smooth (but too wide... no joke please).  The brand is good.  NVMe PCIe SSD is decent, far from the best, but I can live with that.  It's really thin, and without the compromise of no LAN or no camera.  Overall, a good looking notebook.What I dislike:No mDP, which is strange, because my GS65 has a mDP, and many of my friends have mDP to DP cable for external G-sync monitor.  I am forced to carry my own cable if I'm at friends house.  None of my friends has Type C display, nor Type C to DP cable.The windows button.  Although for gaming, I sometimes disable my windows button.  The windows button is on the right side of the space bar.  I mean I can get used it if I really try, but come on... GS65 and GS75 both RTX, and different KB layout?  And don't get me started with the \" | \" and \" \ \" keys.....  Yes.  KEYS.  Why is it so important to have a duplicate of this key cap.  No biggy.  I guess.  This is nip picking.  No points taken off.  It's just annoying.Minor light leak when system is totally black.  No points taken off.  I think it's typical.  It's just hard to fix when the bezel seems to be glued to the screen.  Leakage is not noticeable in normal usage on my system.My biggest complaint is not on MSI, but just this particular unit that I have.  System at or around idle, I saw 86 degree frequently, and fans constantly pulse between quiet and the next level.  Some of the lightest load, 6-7% CPU load, a second later, the fans start going bunkers.Running a simple 3DMARK11P, temp went up to  97-99 degree many times.  Granted, I shouldn't be running monitoring device while running benchmark.  It was because of the thermal throttling that I was experiencing that trigger my curiosity to monitor the temp.Add salt to the wound.  I would've been ok to take apart the system, and attempt to re-paste the system, as needed, had it not been the \"FACTORY SEAL\" covering one of the screw holes.  I don't want to void any factory warranty, should it come to that down the road.Looking at my other MSI notebook.  I would guess mine is just an one off for temperature issue.

Will definitely update within a couple months to see how everything's going.Another quick note - When I'm playing a resource heavy game, and have the fans on full blast(If you didn't know you can change the speed of the fans from within the dragon center) it does a wonderful job of keeping everything cool.SIDE NOTE - if you are upgrading the storage, the M2 slots already have the screws, but only a single pair SO DON'T LOSE THEM.Maybe worth mentioning? - Start up to login takes about 15-20 seconds. And half the time takes less than that.Honestly this laptop can take whatever you hurl at it.Stop reading and buy.

    I play video games. I use virtual machines. I bought the 32GB DDR4 RAM, 512 GB NVME, 2080 Max Q design of this laptop. The keyboard is stunning and takes a little bit of getting used to. I love the fact they removed the Windows key from the WASD side of the keyboard. The onboard software packed with this is very nice and limited. Gives great functionality of the machine.There are 2 empty slots for additional NVME drives to add. I picked up some 970 EVO NVME's from Samsung.(NOTE) I have added a picture of what not to do. Please refer to this, otherwise you may think your drive bay is defective.No regrets from purchasing this rig. Also, as a bonus, the footprint is nearly identical to my 3 year old 15\" laptop. Even though this is a 17\". Also, this laptop is lighter and thinner on top of that. The only thing I may want is to get some sort of second skin to protect the fingerprint magnets that are this matte black. Which is very pretty btw.

    After several months of researching gaming laptops, I chose the MSI GS75 Stealth-093 based on the high-end specs (won't need to upgrade and it should run anything and everything), design, and reviews. I could not be happier with my choice for the following reasons: Prime 2-day delivery, triple boxed for protection, nicely packaged from MSI, beautiful 17\" display, SteelSeries Engine 3 MSI Per Key RGB Keyboard (multi-color back lit keyboard with different colors and lighting options), easy to type, track pad works great with lots of features, boot time is short and everything runs incredibly fast even with the highest game settings, and thin and light with a small form factor and the MSI utility software is excellent and very useful. The build and design quality are exceptional.Let me address some comments from other reviewers that may be helpful. Please consider that not every laptop can be perfect for everyone. The laptop has a high-end processor and dedicated graphics, so it will get need to circulate the air to cool down the electronic components. You will hear the fans when they run during heavy gaming to cool the high end CPU and graphics card, but it's not obnoxious. The speakers are good considering the laptop is extremely thin and light, but some may expect better. Although MSI reduced the thickness of the power adapter it would be nice if it was smaller. The bloatware is extremely minimal, which I very much appreciated (removed a few games that were probably bundled with Windows 10).  I find the screen opens and closes very smooth with the right amount of tension and the hinges are very sturdy.  The really bad 1 star reviews appear to be fake, probably from a competitor.I will update this review as I put in more time gaming and running other applications. At this point, I am 100% satisfied with the MSI GS75 Stealth laptop.

    The first thing i noticed about the MSI GS75 was the weight, at 4.8 pounds you would think no way this thing is going to perform like the heavy weights in its class. I was so wrong not only did it perform it didn't even break a sweat with COD4 and a 4K UHD movie running with excel heavy formulas being performed. 3 hrs of heavy use and the fans came on about 45 mins into the tasks. I love the black and gold design with the slim bezel and light weight, couldn't be happier. My only grip in the power cord easily slips out the charging port because of the weight and gauge of the cord.All an all the MSI GS75 - 093 is the best option for those wanting a super multi use laptop. 5 yr protection plan purchased also.

    Yep I'm a bit crazy about this laptop.  Personally I think its worth the money for it.  In fact I would say it is the best laptop I have ever owned.  Sure its expensive and maybe not more than 20% better than previous generation of laptops, but it is well made and its so nice having 17 inch screen on a thin and lite.  You could argue all about GPU performance isn't worth it, but to me its more than that with this machine.  It has everything I have ever wanted in a laptop and then some.  If it wasn't for the fact I have a kick ass desktop too, I would so replace the desktop with this laptop.

    Two units have failed. We were able to return the first to Amazon (which has a fabulous return policy) but the second one failed a week after the return period expired. My granddaughter, who received the machine from me as her birthday present, is contacting the manufacturer. We'll see what happens, but right now I would say: “Don’t buy this machine!”

    I received my MSI GS75 yesterday. For years I have been what most people would consider a nerd, or a techie. I've built computers and spent exorbitant amounts of money on unnecessary purchases in the tech field. This is no exception. When I turned this thing on it was nearly instant. I had a 2 year old lenovo yoga before this and it was great, but nowhere near the speed this thing is going to offer. I have already downloaded BFV and Civ 6. In Battlefield I am getting over 60 fps with ultra settings and RTX on. The new DLSS update seems to have worked like they said it would. In Civ the turns are insanely fast. I have spent years playing that game and spent even more years waiting in-between turns. Those days are gone ladies and gentlemen. I can't wait to see what else this thing has to offer in terms of performance, but as for the other qualities they're great too. The keys feel like the chiclet apple-style keys, they're great. The RGB on presets alone on the keyboard are impressive, although I set mine to a steady color immediately. I/O on this laptop is untouchable. There just aren't many thin and lights offering this amount of ports, I have more than enough. Lastly, the weight and form-factor. They cannot be any better. The laptop is slightly below five pounds and slightly above 6 pounds with the charger. It is thinner than my lenovo and barely heavier. The size of the screen is misleading, in the best possible. When you open GS75 (with your weakest finger) you are really able to appreciate the beauty and craftsmanship of this device. The bezels are pushed out to the furthest limits, allowing for maximum screen and very little bulk as far as carrying goes. I hope you guys all enjoy this thing as much as I do!

    I wrote a great review for this the day after I got it because it ran games great despite having a loud fan, but I am returning this today.I went to restart my system after installing some software and it got stuck on the logo while loading. I searched and found it is a really common issue, found some suggestions and was able to get it to start up again. Didn't actually use it at that point so it went back to sleep. When I went to wake it up it got stuck on the logo and the steps I took before to get it to work didn't work.I called MSI technical support (not amazon) and they gave me steps to get it to work. Which were basically what I had done on my own, but involved pushing the battery reset button twice (doing that on the bottom of the laptop for 30 sec with a 10 sec pause in between, holding the power button for about a minute, then powering it up while holding the delete key to enter bios and changing the boot priority). I used it all night, but the next morning it was stuck on the logo. Didn't feel like talking to tech support again or sending it in as I've only had it about a week and can just return it through amazon. Quite disappointed though as it was an amazing computer that was great to play any game I tried on it.

    Although I paid for a an over night shipping, this unit came in much later than then what when it's supposed to be delivered.  But, no points are taken off for that.  As I am a proud owner of a GS65 also from Best Buy RTX2060.What I like:Per key RGB is beautiful and stunning.  Pressing the Fn key lights up the available Fn key is cool.  The touch pad feels smooth (but too wide... no joke please).  The brand is good.  NVMe PCIe SSD is decent, far from the best, but I can live with that.  It's really thin, and without the compromise of no LAN or no camera.  Overall, a good looking notebook.What I dislike:No mDP, which is strange, because my GS65 has a mDP, and many of my friends have mDP to DP cable for external G-sync monitor.  I am forced to carry my own cable if I'm at friends house.  None of my friends has Type C display, nor Type C to DP cable.The windows button.  Although for gaming, I sometimes disable my windows button.  The windows button is on the right side of the space bar.  I mean I can get used it if I really try, but come on... GS65 and GS75 both RTX, and different KB layout?  And don't get me started with the \" | \" and \" \ \" keys.....  Yes.  KEYS.  Why is it so important to have a duplicate of this key cap.  No biggy.  I guess.  This is nip picking.  No points taken off.  It's just annoying.Minor light leak when system is totally black.  No points taken off.  I think it's typical.  It's just hard to fix when the bezel seems to be glued to the screen.  Leakage is not noticeable in normal usage on my system.My biggest complaint is not on MSI, but just this particular unit that I have.  System at or around idle, I saw 86 degree frequently, and fans constantly pulse between quiet and the next level.  Some of the lightest load, 6-7% CPU load, a second later, the fans start going bunkers.Running a simple 3DMARK11P, temp went up to  97-99 degree many times.  Granted, I shouldn't be running monitoring device while running benchmark.  It was because of the thermal throttling that I was experiencing that trigger my curiosity to monitor the temp.Add salt to the wound.  I would've been ok to take apart the system, and attempt to re-paste the system, as needed, had it not been the \"FACTORY SEAL\" covering one of the screw holes.  I don't want to void any factory warranty, should it come to that down the road.Looking at my other MSI notebook.  I would guess mine is just an one off for temperature issue.

    I tried the MSI GS65 Stealth with the 1070 max-q, and while I liked the design and loved the battery life I found it limited. The mother board was upside down and made upgrading a pain which was a serious problem since the storage was limited to 512 GBs. However they have improved on that slightly with the GS75. While the motherboard is still upside down so repasting and swapping ram is still a chore, it now has 3 M.2. drive slots accessible by just removing the bottom! Makes expanding your storage a breeze. I can not stress how important it is to make sure you get a build with 2 sticks of ram in it for dual channel. Unless you are very comfortable taking apart then putting back together laptops you don't want to do anything more to this than add SSDs, you have been warned. The performance while playing Anthem is amazing and my benchmarks are about what was expected. Nothing life changing, but much cooler than the GTX laptops and slightly better performance. Hopefully as RTX gains more traction and the drivers improve there will be a much more noticeable performance gain over RTX. However if you're an early adopter like me then you know how things go, and as such don't be surprised by the naysayers talking about your marginal gains. The real advantage here is all the power from GTX and more with lower thermals. No more laptops you can cook an egg on! Over all I love it, I just wish it was a bit more powerful hence the 4 stars instead of 5. Still i highly recommend this to anyone who doesn't mind dropping 3K on a thin and light desktop replacement.

    Aesthetics and Gaming performanceBeautiful Laptop, there's no denial there. The customization and colors of the keyboard are a wonderful bonus. It takes some time getting used to it, but once you're used it rocks. Strangely I don't get as many compliments on the \"RTX\" series sticker as opposed to my \"Disco\" preset keyboard lighting. Go figure.  The graphics card speaks for itself in many ways and lives up to the expectation, in my opinion. There's still some faults, but optimization of the 2080 max q will come with time. The big thing here is that you can run any game on max settings and usually get between 60 - 100fps. The even bigger thing here is the amount of all that hardware in such a slim laptop. It definitely overpowers desktops in terms of performance on gaming. I don't think we need to get to much into gaming, as you can look at the hardware and just imagine the FPS on Ultra setting.Upgrades - I bought a Samsung 970 Evo 1TB SSD and Migrated then changed the boot BIOS to that, and have kept original 512 SSD as storage. Overkill? Why yes, yes it is. But in addition to gaming, I need all the space for apps like Unity 3D, Android Studio , Oracle, Eclipse, etc etc. So I needed more than the stock 512 IMO.Start up time? What's that?Screen quality is beautiful. I mean are there better resolutions? Yes. Will you notice? Not really.Portability - I bought an Anti-Theft backpack advertised as 17\" along side this and it fits, rather too tight , into it. I still haven't gotten passed the treat it like it's made of super thin glass phase. But the portability is easier than my 15 inch Toshiba, and with the thin size can slip easily into 17 inch bags/sleeves.Is it worth 3,000? Why yes, yes it is. Do not regret my purchase, and will go as far as saying this has opened my eyes to MSI, to which I approached with caution before. Will definitely update within a couple months to see how everything's going.Another quick note - When I'm playing a resource heavy game, and have the fans on full blast(If you didn't know you can change the speed of the fans from within the dragon center) it does a wonderful job of keeping everything cool.SIDE NOTE - if you are upgrading the storage, the M2 slots already have the screws, but only a single pair SO DON'T LOSE THEM.Maybe worth mentioning? - Start up to login takes about 15-20 seconds.
